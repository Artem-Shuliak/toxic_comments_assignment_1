      "Left-Right has nothing to do with position on social issues. It's amazing how you think so. Please, research how the words left and right are used, and how they were originally used, and you will find out that they have nothing to do with abortion, gay marriage, discrimination etc. You certainly lack a high school diploma, so it's pointless to argue with you. I understand that many people think the Nazi party was far-right, but their positions on most issues had nothing in similar to right-wing policies. Of course you are an American idiot who thinks just because Republicans are generally Christian and oppose gay marriage and drug legalization, that the term Right is used to refer to people with these positions. Left and Right are terms which relate to how the state interferes with the economy. Any non-biased informed person would agree that the Nazis were completely far-left - I mean, a strong state running the economy and controlling the press and the media have nothing to do with the Right.\n",

      "The topic of mutual intelligibility in Slavic languages is a bit difficult. For example, Bulgarian is routinely regarded as a language most distant from the Slavic type and very difficult to understand for most Slavs. In Czech, there even exists a saying \"\"speaking like a Bulgarian\"\" for unintelligible speech. Yet the difficulties in understanding lie mainly in grammar (the non-existence of word-endings, the use of articles). You can listen to a Bulgarian, not to understand a word and doubt, if you are actually listening to an Indo-European language - and then you see a Bulgarian text and you are surprised that you can read it quite with ease. So the difference in understanding spoken language and written language can be huge. \n",
      "As for the difference between Czech/Slovak and Polish, I must agree with the Polish contributor above that a fluent conversation is not possible. Yet you can certainly understand a lot and conduct some conversation, if you try to be patient. So \"\"a limited intelligibility\"\" would be a more correct term. As for written Polish, Czechs and Slovaks shouldn't have any difficulties with a general understanding Polish text, although quite a few words (especially of technical sort) may seem obscure and untintelligible. However, the closest Slavic language to Czech (after Slovak) is Lusitan Sorbian, especially Upper Sorbian. I don't have any personal experience with this language, but from the written texts I saw I think that its resemblance to Czech can be compared to East Slovakian dialects (which means that you can understand some passages easily, but subsequently you can be lost due to accumulation of weirdly sounding words.)   \"\n",

I added it again, then specifically referenced the blog post (from the official site) with a youtube video which had the the band confirming their new single. Status again undid my changes stating \"\"tumblr, really?\"\" which I know tumblr isn't a reliable source, however if he cared to actually click the link and read and watch the youtube link, he would have seen it was an official tumblr account and youtube account.

What's the explanation?  The Cabal is, obviously, trying to manipulate the encyclopedia article 'jim bell', to keep its errors and omissions from being fixed.  But that's not enough.  They want to (need to!) conceal evidence of their nefarious activites, and that includes instantly (if possible) removing critical references to their misconduct, even on the talk:jim bell page.  (And all references to their misconduct will be critical:  The Cabal ignores all objections to its manipulations, other than to delete, reverse, erase, or otherwise conceal them.)   It remains no violation of WP rules to post from an IP address, particularly if the Cabal is preventing people from correcting an articles errors by any other means.  The Cabal blocks people illegally, so the public is forced to employ other tactics to avoid the Cabal's finagling fingers.  Fortunately, the identities of the Cabal are now (at least, in part) being exposed.  Skomorokh, strangely, is holding back, perhaps fearful of losing control over his high-priority 'assignment'.  Actually, if Skomorokh were honest and ethical, he would by now either have weighed in on the subject, or he would have explicitly dissociated himself from the dispute.  (Rather than merely remaining silent.) And since most of the incorrect 'misinformation' on 'jim bell' originated from Skomorokh's edits, he should be willing to step aside and allow his errors to be corrected.      71.36.117.224  \"\n",

      "\"Hip-Hop Is NOT Dead But Ready To \"\"Get It\"\"!!! (Calif) Hip-hop producer and west coast native E. Re-ill debuts his album “Get It”. “Get It” is the representation of E. Re-ill's mindset, \"\"I'm in a place in my life where I need to become who I am... I got to “Get It”!!! says E. Re-ill. “Get It” is an album that when focused on can bring out the drive in you to make your dreams real. Why you may ask? You need three things to achieve your goals Hope (expectations), Hustle (drive) and Hunger (appetite for success). These three mindsets are displayed in this album which accompanied by your dreams this will enable your inner being to ““Get It”!” E. Re-ill has been producing beats since the late 80's, influenced by Dr. Dre (and who isn't), Rick Rubin, performed with many stars, and has participated in great projects. A prior and classic venture was with the street-ball company Y.P.A. and the DVD titled \"\"The War\"\". E. Re-ills’ most rememberable time in making music is when N.W.A. was filming the classic controversial video \"\"Straight Outta Compton\"\" E. Re-ill's older brother caught the attention of Ice Cube and filmed Ice Cube telling E. Re-ill to keep up and he'll see him on top!!! That statement would drive E.Re-ill for many years. Hip-Hop has always been the “in touch with your inner voice” music and then we have always informed our community of how we see the actions displayed in front of us. Hip-Hop can be fun, dark, and everything in between. However, usually no matter the topic a hip-hop song it should captivate you!!! “Get It” is no exception to this, “Get It” displays emotional drive, creative sound packages, consistent vibe and sounds, and arguably some of the best lyrics delivered on hip-hop tracks in a long while. Songs like \"\"Dark People\"\" a description of pushing your self to great heights even when life shorts you of opportunities. \"\"I'm So Gangsta\"\" is a nice surprise!!! It is Fresh Caesar's look at the world biggest gangsta George Bush, and his fumbles with war and Katrina!!! Don't cheat yourself I'm so Gangsta is a necessary download!!! Oakland native and a brilliant lyricist Fresh Caesar (a.k.a. Omega) is currently working on his own album titled \"\"Jack London’s Square\"\". Fresh Caesar displays lyrical strengths of Nas and Jay-Z with a west coast flavor delivery. Fresh Caesar displays great lyrical ability and is definitely not your average rapper on the mic. Down South/Oakland rapper, Tom-E-Gunn has the sounds of Snoop Dogg's early gangsta swag with grit of the south. These songs are actually lost demos recently found. E. Re-ill felt compelled to use the demos for the world to hear due to their strong delivery of life experiences. E. Re-ill's “Get It” album is about all the aspirations that we desire in life money, success, respect, reflections of life, and excess of women and parties. This is the start of great things to come from this talented producer. iTunes search E.Re-ill (no spaces), Contact: myspace.com/ereill1 Also available on rhapsody, emusic, napster, Amazon...\"\n",

He feels he has the right to discredit all studies he disagrees with, and that everyone should accept his theories as absolute fact.  I could just as easily creat a website presenting an opposite view and discrediting studies that Racial Reality likes.  But I am not that dishonest.  My point was to present the other side of the story, while leaving Racial Reality's also valid side there as well; in this way, the reader can draw his or her own conclusions. But the way the article is now is extremely one-sided.\n",

This fact doesn't discredit older studies that use blood groups, since the blood groups and blood proteins used are specific to certain populations.  Since the decoding of the human genome, we have access to more sensitive methods of determing admixture.  \n",
      "\n",
      "An example of how blood groups studies are valid is the Duffy null marker. The Duffy blood-group types have been known for many decades, as has their usefulness in identifying continent of ancestry. But it has been only within the past decade that we have known that a person's Duffy blood-group type is encoded on the long arm of his/her chromosome #1, about 23.2 centimorgans out from the chromosome's centromere. \n",

If anything, serological analysis will understimate true admixture. \n",

      "The Ghiani study specifically states that it shows significant admixture.  Anyone can see this when reading the abstract.

Five percent or more is usually considered statistically significant.\n",

      "The Calo study presents support for the east-west division in Sicily, and shows relatedness between Sicilians and Egyptians.  Egyptians were imported to Sicily during the Saracen period as farmers, so the connection between Sicilians and Egyptians is not spurious. The study's use of perfectly valid blood group and mtDNA studies which show sub-Saharan admixture in Sicily were merely to show that other studies found \"\"African\"\" admixture there, regardless of whether it was sub-Saharan or North African.  There are other studies which lump the two together. The whole point was to show a relationship with the (diverse) peoples of the continent of Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Semino study from 1989 which found 4 sub-Saharan haplotypes out of a population of 91 diverse Sicilians is not \"\"problematic,\"\" as Racial Reality would have us believe, but is a perfectly valid mtDNA study using restriction enzymes, a method still widely used today, since it is cost-effective and accurate.  RFLP's cut the DNA at specified locations, and \"\"indels\"\" (insertion and deletions polymorphisms) are very easy to spot in this way. There are other studies that have found less (or in one case, no) sub-Saharan material in the Sicilian gene pool.  This is normal, since all samples are different, and because of this, all tests will yield different results.  One certainly can't \"\"refute\"\" or \"\"overrule\"\" the other.  The 2001 Vona study (finding no sub-Saharan genes in Sicilians) that referenced the 1989 Semino study did so for comparison purposes only.  Furthermore, it tested only 49 Siclians from the single villige of Alia.  No reliable conclusions can be reached for the Sicilian population as a whole from such a narrow sample.  Dr. Ornella Semino, a former colleage of mine, found it both amusing and a bit disturbing when I mentioned to here that certain non-professional forum posters considered her study \"\"outdated\"\" or \"\"overruled\"\" or \"\"refuted\"\"  all absolute drivel!\n",

      " Hi there! Thank you for your querie about the Humanistic teachings of Nichiren Buddhism. Let me start by saying that the title \"\"Humanistic Buddhism\"\" is rather sematically weak: because there are no 2 types of Buddhism: one Humanistic and another non-Humanistic. I think we should alter the title into \"\"Buddhist Humanism\"\". If you trace the word Humanism you'll find various views: Christian Humanism, secular Humanism...etc... and adding the term \"\"Buddhist Humanism\"\" is appropriate. \n",
      "\n",
      " Secondly, the term Humanistic Buddhism or Buddhist Humanism, whether in China or Japan or the USA, is based on the Buddha's teachings - in particular the teachings of the Lotus Sutra. (The article mentions this clearly). The Lotus Sutra - of course - is not a private property of a certain temple or nation (Chinese, Japanese etc...) Buddhism of the Lotus Sutra is a universal teaching for all Humanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, it was TienTai of China who placed the Lotus Sutra as the highest of the Buddha's teachings. Later it was introduced to Japan and the Tendai Sect emerged upholding the Lotus teachings, which was the ground for Nichiren, who appeared in 1222, to declare his teachings based solely on the Lotus Sutra. Currently, a 12 millions Samgha Nichiren Buddhist group (the Soka Gakkai International) is actively working for: \"\"Spreading Buddhist Humanism in the Community\"\" http://www.sgi.org/about-us/members-stories/spreading-buddhist-humanism-in-the-community.html\n",
      "\n",
      " Nichiren Buddhism focuses on the Lotus Sutra: “Buddhist humanism:  It is a philosophical perspective that reflects the core spirit of the Lotus Sutra”\n",
      "Buddhist Humanism: http://www.daisakuikeda.org/main/philos/buddhist/buddh-05.html\n",
      "\n",
      " I think it is more accurate and more professional to refer to Buddhism as either Theravada or Mahayana. In China or Japan, you have Buddhist schools which are either Theravada or Mahayana. There is no such thing as \"\"Chinese\"\" Buddhism and \"\"Japanese\"\" Buddhism. Using the term Chinese or Japanese Buddhism is plainly wrong. For example Zen has branches and temples in both Japan & China. It remains Zen. No need here for confusing \"\"passport\"\" added to Buddhism. Nichiren Buddhism is found all over the world but mostly parcticed in Japan, this does not make it Japanese, but correctly: a Mahayana school based on the Lotus Sutra. It is even not logical to speak about Humanism and Humanity and in the same time restrict Buddhism to artificial national descriptions of  Chinese and Japanese terms. \n",
      "\n",
      " Wikipedia articles must be impartial and must bring various views. Humanistic values of Buddhism cannot be patented to this temple or that priest only. All respect worthy people working to spread Buddhist Humanism must be acknowledged. I am doing research to include the participation of various Mahayana schools in the teachings of Humanism of the Buddha teachings which are for all Humanity.

If you think the subject represented more than ten percent of the firearms or ammunition, it's probably a top importance article; but it's probably not top importance if you have doubts.

Read \"\"The theory that prenatally established brain and CNS   structures determine innate gender feelings and gender identity.\"\"  \"\"It appears that if those brain and CNS structures are masculinized   in early pregnancy by hormones in the fetus, then the child will   have male percepts and a male gender identity, independent of   whether the genes or genitalia are male. If those structures   are not masculinized in early pregnancy, the child will have   a female percepts and a female gender identity, again independent   of the genes or genitalia. As in the case of intersex infants   having ambiguous genitalia, there are undoubtedly many degrees   of cross-gendering of brain and CNS structures, so that while   some infants are completely cross-gendered others are only partially   cross-gendered.(verbatim)\"\"  This is basically the feminine essence theory.

Homosexual males have been shown to think and have some brain structures like those of straight women.  A homosexual transsexual is just a case where there is more enough female brain structure present to make a person mentally female.  While non-homosexual transsexuals, if I understood correctly, also have cross gender structures in their brains, just not the same as a homosexual transsexuals.  The non-homosexual MTF transsexual brains retaining more masculine brain structure.  That is the crux of the problem isn't it now.

We knew they were Germanic before that. Are you implying that there is a connection between Dutch and Frankish \"\"ethnicity\"\"? That connection, though it is probably there, is not very direct over a thousand five hundred years...\n",
      "I don't know why the fact that a Frankish-derived language (Dutch) being spoken in a certain region (the Netherlands) should force us to believe that the Franks were originally from there. Of course the two facts are related, but the fact of the language being spoken there does not itself tell us that at one point in time its inhabitants were primarily Franks any more than the fact that a Latin-derived language is spoken in Belgium tells us that at one point in time its inhabitants were primarily Romans. Again, I understand the connection, but it is not made on linguistic analysis alone. This is why most books/articles on the Franks that I've read (Wallace-Hadrill, Bachrach) don't mention Dutch. Your comment about Franci seniores (what does the Franci superiores have to do with anything?) does nothing to explain to me the importance of their language. Their well-attested written language was Latin. Why not mention that? In fact, it tells us far more about the Franks than that they spoke a proto-Dutch language. \n",

      "These are prior comments from earlier this year (2011) that were ignored:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Wikipedia Elective surgery states: \"\"Elective surgery is surgery that is scheduled in advance because it does not involve a medical emergency. Semi-elective surgery is a surgery that must be done to preserve the patient's life, but does not need to be performed immediately.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Medicinenet.com defines the term Elective surgery as follows: \"\"Surgery that is subject to choice (election)...As opposed to urgent or emergency surgery.\"\" []\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Medicinenet.com defines the term Elective as follows: \"\"In medicine, something chosen (elected). An elective procedure is one that is chosen (elected) by the patient or physician that is advantageous to the patient but is not urgent. Elective surgery is decided by the patient or their doctor. The procedure is seen as beneficial but not absolutely essential at that time.\"\" []\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Wikipedia Surgery states: \"\"Types of surgery: Surgical procedures are the commonly categorized by urgency, type of procedure, body system involved, degree of invasiveness, and special instrumentation. Based on timing: Elective surgery is done to correct a non-life-threatening condition, and is carried out at the patient's request, subject to the surgeon's and the surgical facility's availability. Emergency surgery is surgery which must be done promptly to save life, limb, or functional capacity. A semi-elective surgery is one that must be done to avoid permanent disability or death, but can be postponed for a short time. Based on purpose: Exploratory surgery is performed to aid or confirm a diagnosis. Therapeutic surgery treats a previously diagnosed condition.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus a reasonable person would conclude that non-emergency therapeutic surgery is a subcategory of elective surgery. Nearly all surgical abortions are NOT emergency procedures (in other words, they are scheduled procedures and are not medical emergencies).      \n",
      "\n",
      "It seems that this Abortion article's inartful use of the terms \"\"elective\"\" and \"\"therapeutic\"\" confuses the reader rather than clarifying important distinctions. One would use \"\"elective\"\" to describe a procedure based on the timing of the surgery. One would use the term \"\"therapeutic\"\" to describe a procedure based on whether there has been a diagnosis.  The 2 terms are not mutually exclusive.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If the terms \"\"elective\"\" and \"\"therapeutic\"\" are to be applied consistently (with no politically correct definitions for procedures performed on pregnant women), then virtually all therapeutic abortions are also elective procedures. Practically speaking, in nearly all modern situataions the 2 terms will be mutually inclusive because modern medicine considers the satisfaction of any woman's desire to no longer be pregnant (regardless of the reason why she no longer wants to be pregnant) as \"\"therapeutic\"\", and abortion is virtually NEVER performed under emergency conditions (in other words: there are virtually no occurences in which an abortion must be done immediately to avoid a serious health risk).   \n",
      "\n",
      "The current section of this article called \"\"Induced\"\" [] contains a false dichotomy when it states: \"\"Reasons for procuring induced abortions are typically characterized as either therapeutic or elective. An abortion is medically referred to as a therapeutic abortion when it is performed to: ... An abortion is referred to as elective when it is performed at the request of the woman \"\"for reasons other than maternal health or fetal disease.\"\". \n",
      "\n",
      "This false dichotomy should be corrected by helping the reader understand that the 2 terms therapeutic and elective are virtually synonymous, rather than leading the reader to incorrectly think that an abortion is EITHER elective OR therapeutic. Rarely will any therapeutic abortion not also be elective.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, using the term \"\"therapeutic\"\" also implies that the condition of being pregnant is a disease or a health defect, when in reality, absent any political use of medical terminology, pregnancy is a sign of a healthy reproductive system and is never a disease. There are extremely rare occassions when organs of or near the reproductive tract are diseased and an abortion could thus be therepeutic to the gravid woman (though fatal to the fetus). \n",

A policy proposal, if you seriously want it made effective, needs several things.  It should be linked to Wikipedia:Policy thinktank (that may be a category thing now...haven't proposed anything in ages).  It should be announced that it is available for discussion in as many public ways as you can think of (I'd say the village pump and the mailing list are best...probably WP:AN too).  Set a time (say, 1 month?) that is left for discussion only (that is, voting will not start until at least ).  Once discussion has reached some kind of consensus, establish a clear voting schedule (what possible votes may be cast  yes, no, neutral, for example  what each type of vote means in real terms, how long voting will last, who is eligible to vote, whether or not the question may be altered once votign is underway, etc.).  Alternatively, if discussion seems generally to favor the idea (but it's not clear that there's enough consensus to make it enforceable policy), it may simply linger as Wikipedia:Semi-policy, in other words, a principle that's a very good idea that a lot of people like, but which for one reason or another isn't fully policy.

Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.\n",

Why the anachronistic \"\"classical\"\"? Neither the 10-stringed harp-guitar of the 19th century nor the modern 10-string guitar is an instrument from the Classical period, and an acoustic guitar is as little limited to the performance of so-called \"\"Classical\"\" music as an acoustic piano is. And what exactly is meant by \"\"extended-range\"\"? Extended from what? This is assuming that the guitar had a fixed range, which is a fallacy considering most of the notable guitarists of the 19th century (Sor, Carulli, Coste, Mertz, Legnani, Manjon, etc.) also wrote for/performed on guitars with more than 6 strings, many of which had a treble range that was extended beyond the 19th/20th fret that is the norm on today's guitars. All in all this is a nonsensical title for an article that should simply be called \"\"ten-string guitar\"\" that that should include only historically significant instruments (i.e. not things like the Marlow 10-string guitar). And there should be a separate article for the \"\"Yepes 10-string guitar\"\", which this article currently simply continues to confuse with unrelated developements that have nothing to do with the primary defining characteristic of the Yepes instrument: its singualr tuning which uniquely gives sympathetic string resonance in unison with any note fretted on the treble strings.\n",

      "Regarding you two non-Urantia Book reading nerds - Wazronk and Richiar - if you play games with what you don't know, then you're in for a fight. First of all, you two idiots, if you even bothered to look at the Urantia Readers-Intl website, you would know that it is not an advertising site, but a legitimate non-profit Urantia organization. Because you are not a member of the Urantia movement, and if you were, we would know who you are, you do not even know the history of the Urantia Readers-Intl - which by the way has a larger dedicated following then either the now falling apart Urantia Book Fellowship, and the failing Urantia Association International. \n",
      "\n",
      "For your edification, the Urantia Readers-Intl is the original Urantia Brotherhood from 1950, and the only group still holding the flame of the original Doctrine of Trust from its creation. The Urantia Book Fellowship created itself in 1989 as it broke off from the Urantia Brotherhood and the Urantia Foundation. The Foundation created another group called the Urantia Association International for some ridiculous reason, because they had the legal rights to the Urantia Brotherhood organization, and still do. Nevertheless, the Urantia Association International, as in the same direction as the Urantia Book Fellowship, fell into bad management and nefarious direction, and lost sight of the original Midwayer mandates. As such, the true remaining \"\"loyalist\"\" migrated from the Urantia Brotherhood to the Urantia Association International. \n",
      "\n",
      "Over time the Urantia Association International, because of lack of true sagacity, was infiltrated by members of the rebel Urantia Book Fellowship organization. As such, the \"\"loyalist\"\" members to the Urantia movement, many of whom where members of the Urantia Association of Florida, grabbed the torch and reorganized the original Urantia Brotherhood as the Urantia Readers-Intl. Because you two dummies are not a direct part of the Urantia movement, and again we say this because we would know who you are if you were - you do not know who is who and what is what. You don't even know that the Urantia Book Fellowship is a counter Urantia movement organization. But, you are obviously not true thinkers, but that is not the issue. \n",
      "\n",
      "The issue is that you two jerks keep deleting our external link from this section. We never deleted your links to the Urantia Book Fellowship, but added are link, not apparent to what place it was, but over and over we find it deleted, so now we have game on... you delete us, we delete you. So, if you put the Urantia Book Fellowship link back in, and keep ours in, the we keep yours in. Because you've pissed us off, if you place the Urantia Book Fellowship link above us, we will place our link above you. This is in retrospect to your piousness. So suffer with it. That's life, and perhaps maybe one of you two idiots will someday realize who the Urantia Readers-Intl really is, who the Urantia Book Fellowship really is, and who is the original group with the original doctrine - but we already know that you two bozos don't have what it takes to figure this out in this life time. The truce is... Urantia Readers-Intl first, Urantia Book Fellowship second, Urantia Association International third... at least for now, then maybe someday we'll swap order, just to appease the dark side. But for now this better be it, or we're going to go back and forth with you wimps and beat you at your own game. Capishe?  02:53, 29\"\n",

      "Germ Out is a liquid instant hand sanitizer that contains two germ killers, 70 wt% isopropyl alcohol and 0.02 wt% benzalkonium chloride and a moisturizer, glycerin. Germ Out kills 99.99% of germs on the hands in 30 seconds. All alcohol gels, including Purell and Germ X etc., contain one germ killer, 62 v% ethyl alcohol. Two germ killers are significantly more effective than one germ killer and 70 wt% alcohol kills germs better than 62 v% alcohol. Since Germ Out is a liquid and not a gel, it spreads easier and more completely and it does not leave any \"\"sticky\"\" residue after it dries. Germ Out can be sprayed on the hands as a fine mist or added drop by drop from a flip top applicator. After wetting the hands thoroughly with Germ Out, they are rubbed together until the alcohol evaporates in approximately 30 seconds. Unlike the alcohol gels which kill germs for only 30 seconds, Germ Out continues killing germs for approximately 4 hours due to the second germ killer benzalkonium chloride which remains on the hands after the alcohol is gone.\n",

      "It's surely not intended as a JavaScript tutorial, but you see, you can't really discuss a programming language without delving into it's syntax. Is this a bad thing? I don't think so - there are a lot of misconceptions about JavaScript (many of those are caused by bad tutorials on the web) and we can eliminate those by presenting a clear picture of the language. I've seen the statement that \"\"JavaScript doesn't support private members\"\" too often to be funny - even on this page before I edited that out. Stating in the article that JavaScript supports private members eliminates this misconception, but you need a code sample to prove your point. Since people can actually see with their own eyes how it works this adds to the credibility of the article. So you want to discuss closures? If you don't mention them, the article fails to mention one of the defining properties of JavaScript. If you do mention them, the shortest and cleanest way to explain the concept is through a code sample. As long as we structure the information in an appropriate way we need not necessarily be afraid that we've got too much of it.  \"\n",

      "Thank you for your reports at Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism. I find that you are a reliable contributor, and frequently make useful reports. However, you do sometimes seem a little too quick to jump straight to final warnings and AIV without milder warnings first. It is certainly not necessary to always go through the whole sequence of level 1 warning, level 2, level 3, level 4, but in almost all cases there should have been at least a couple of warnings, and an immediate \"\"final warning\"\" to a new user without previous warnings should be reserved for extreme cases, such as serious personal attacks. One other point is that it is worth thinking whether \"\"vandalism\"\" is always the right label. For example, you warned and reported Brendo1337 for vandalism, but to me his/her editing looked more like experimenting than vandalism, and a word of advice to experiment in the sandbox instead of an article may perhaps have been sufficient. I certainly do not wish to put you off, as you make very useful contributions to vandal fighting, as I have already said. However, you may find it helpful to consider my suggestions.   \n",

Up to that point, djembe and dunun were confined to the traditional Malinke area (Mali, Guinea, and parts of Burkina Faso, Senegal, and Ivory Coast).)

      "Hall thrusters were studied independently in the US and the USSR in the 1950s and '60s. However, the concept of a Hall thruster was only developed into an efficient propulsion device in the former Soviet Union, whereas in the US, scientists focused instead on developing girded ion thruster. Two types of Hall thrusters were developed in the Soviet Union:\n",

      "Soviet and Russian SPD thrusters\n",
      "The common SPD design was largely the work of A. I. Morozov. SPD engines were operated since 1972. They were mainly used for satellite stabilization in North-South and in East-West directions. Since then until the late 1990s 118 SPD engines completed their mission and some 50 continued to be operated. Thrust of the first generation of SPD engines, SPD-50 and SPD-60 was 20 and 30 mN respectively. In 1982 SPD-70 and SPD-100 were introduced, their thrust being 40 mN and 83 mN. In the post-Soviet Russia high-power (a few kilowatts) SPD-140, SPD-160, SPD-180, T-160 and low-power (less than 500 W) SPD-35 were introduced. SPT-100 has a life time of 8000 hrs, efficiency of 52%.Soviet and Russian DAS-type engines include D-38 and D-55. \n",
      "Soviet-built thrusters were introduced to the West in 1992 after a team of electric propulsion specialists, under the support of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, visited Soviet laboratories and experimentally evaluated the SPD-100 (i.e., a 100 mm diameter SPT thruster). Over 200 Hall thrusters have been flown on Soviet/Russian satellites in the past thirty years. They were used mainly for station keeping and small orbital corrections. Currently Hall Thruster research, design, and theoretical modeling are led by experts at NASA Glenn Research Center and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A considerable amount of development is being conducted in industry, such as Aerojet and Busek Co.\n",
      "This technology was used on the European lunar mission SMART-1 and is used on a number of commercial geostationary satellites. \n",
      "What's a Hall Thruster?    The Hall thruster is a type of plasma-based propulsion systems for space vehicles. The amount of fuel that must be carried by a satellite depends on the speed with which the thruster can eject it. Chemical rockets have very limited fuel exhaust speed. Plasmas can be ejected at much higher speeds; therefore less fuel need be carried on board. The Hall thruster was invented in the late 1950's. Until the mid 1990's, it has been developed primarily by the Russians. During the past 30 years, the Russian placed in orbit more than 100 Hall thrusters. However, the vast majority of satellites worldwide have relied on chemical thrusters and, to a lesser extent, arc jet thrusters and ion thrusters.\n",
      "    A conventional electrostatic ion thruster consists of two grids, an anode and a cathode, between which a voltage drop occurs. Positively charged ions accelerate away from the anode toward the cathode grid and through it. After the ions get past the cathode, electrons are added to the flow, neutralizing the output to keep it moving. A thrust is exerted on the anode-cathode system, in a direction opposite to that of the flow. Unfortunately, a positive charge builds up in the space between the grids, limiting the ion flow and, therefore, the magnitude of the thrust that can be attained.  \n",
      "    In a Hall thruster, electrons injected into a radial magnetic field neutralize the space charge. The magnitude of the applied magnetic field is approximately 100-200 gauss, strong enough to trap the electrons by causing them to spiral around the field lines in the coaxial channel. The magnetic field and a trapped electron cloud together serve as a virtual cathode. The ions, too heavy to be affected by the field, continue their journey through the virtual cathode. The movement of the positive and negative electrical charges through the system results\n",

Later, we find that there are in fact 12 seperate stories but only seven are known to each student, hence the name. Finally, only 8 are listed because those were the only 8 of the 12 presented and there will never be any more; it was purely an aspect of the anime and I highly doubt they'll touch upon it again. Listing what was given to me was all I could do. Also, adding an {{incomplete}} tag wouldn't do any good since aside from the cleanup (which I can do myself), no more information from the 4 missing mysteries or the ones not explained with ever appear in the series.

If it did, the consequences for Wikipedia would be unfortunate, for whereas it might just be possible to quote a citable definition under fair use of copyright, quoting copyrighted examples is surely not on.

      " With this work, the authors, Mayoury and Pheuiphanh Ngaosyvathn, offer us a wealth of information on the history of a small kingdom, the Lao, centered at Vientiane, in modern Laos, caught between expanding core states (Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam) in the late eighteenth- and early nineteenth century. The authors draw upon a wide literature and an impressive range of languages to present a clear and careful picture of a very complex period in Lao and Southeast Asian history.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is really the story of Chou Anou, the last of the Lao kings of Vientiane and his struggle against rivals on all sides. Chou Anou played a political game between the expansionist Thai and Vietnamese states in the late eighteenth and ear]y nineteenth centuries, a game that his kingdom eventually lost. Because of the Tay Son, Vietnam was out of the picture for decades; the central Thai court was Chou Anou's chief antagonist. When Vietnam does enter the picture again under Minh Mang, it is as a supporter of Chou Anou, in the context of a larger Thai-Vietnamese competitive hostility. Fighting between Thailand and Vientiane appears on an extremely personal level in the text — the authors stressing at one point Rama III's anxiety that a massacre of Vietnamese emissaries and Lao guides by a Thai officer had not left enough dead, considering an earlier massacre of Thai by Chou Anou in Vientiane (p. 242); they stress also the personal nature of the fighting between Chou Anou and the Thai general Bodin. Further, the text seems almost to replicate, anachronistically, aspects of war more endemic to the post-World-War II conflicts in Indochina, including a reference to \"\"sophisticated Siamese psychological operations\"\" (p. 212).\n",
      "\n",
      "Paths to Conflagration is organized into nine chapters, each covering a different episode of the period, examined step-by-step, and turns from one incarnation of Vientiane to another — from victim to provocateur to buffer state. Each page is heavy with documentation, but the narrative is lighter. This book has three real strengths. First, it discusses history at the point of intersection between three different polities and does not apply the nation-state \"\"cookie-cutter\"\" approach — looking only at developments as they relate to a state-centered narrative (thus framed by political borders). Instead of the history of Laos, we find here the history of a very turbulent period in which political borders did not mean very much in delineating the boundaries of action. Second, this book makes use of a very wide range of sources, especially from the Thai archives, spanning a large number of languages (including Lao, Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, French, English, and German — both primary sources and secondary literature) and a multitude of perspectives. Third, this book focuses attention on developments sometimes left out of analyses of mainland Southeast Asian history, such as the all-important impact of migration, especially in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It is no mistake that migration is referred to over and over again in chronicles of the period, from western Burma to Vietnam, and that migration is used as metaphor for political change and state reformation for far earlier periods in these chronicles. Here too, migration played a very important role, as the authors stress both migration into the Lao kingdom, and forcible expulsion by the Thais, as a basis for the well-being and even survival of the Vientiane-based state.\n",

Because vermont's coat of arms is so great I would love to see it used somewhere. Maybe as an illustration on the Vermont page, and as its own entry.

I did switch to using svg format for a while, but I found BKChem has some bugs yet to be sorted out, i.e. any compound that has a group with numbers in like NH2 or CF3 comes out with the numbers in huge font that looks totally wrong and out of place. Also the letters are sometimes slightly offset and look untidy, and svgs can't be edited once made nearly so easily as pngs, so I switched back to using pngs as the svg format just doesn't seem so suitable for the kind of images I make. Other wikichemists who make lots of images like  and  also prefer to make pngs so there doesn't seem to be universal consensus on this, even though svg may have been adopted as the official wiki standard.\n",

But there really are a handful of institutions for whom their prestige is so well-known and widespread that it has become one of their defining characteristics.  Harvard University is one of those institutions.  It's essential for readers to understand that Harvard University is one of the most prestigious universities in the world.  That's what so many people know about it and why its alumni are disproportionately represented among the political and economic elite.  Indeed, it's why so many colleges, universities, and other institutions proclaim themselves to be the \"\"Harvard of the (region, category, etc.).\"\"\n",

The two additional sources that were added are great and appreciated, but this gets to another point in that those articles reference several schools as the 'most prestigious'. Should those other schools (top 10? top 5?) also get a similarly cited blurb that proclaims them as among the most prestigious in their header. I think that's the fair treatment question that should be raised to ensure consistency. No other school has a similar grandiose opening as Harvard when numerous surveys have shown that there are a select few other Universities that hold comparable prestige.  (\n",

      "Well, I managed to get the highest possible mark in that subject, so that compensated for some weaker marks, and I managed to enter University without much pressure, so thanks again. Anyway, I was recently surfing the web and I came across this image: http://kronosaurus82.deviantart.com/art/Biggest-Ugliest-Baddest-140881861 As you can see, the animals that appear in it are the same as in the size chart you made, however, we can see some discrepances in their height. So, my question is, is this reconstruction correct in this regard? Tyrannosaurids having longer leg bones that Allosauroids and Spinosaurids (and the latter having a lower profile that other theropods) is pretty common knowledge, and longer leg bones mean more height, but, still, the mounted skeleton of Sue is not that much taller that mounted Giganotosaurus, if I recall correctly, and the mount of Spinosaurus is quite massive...\n",

      "Anyway, about Dromaeosaurs, do you have any idea about the environment Deinonychus and Utahraptor lived in? I ask, mainly, because of the whole feather density (or oven presence, in some cases, it seems), and, after seeing how you reconstructed Achillobator, and the reasoning behind the ratite feathering you gave it, I've been pondering how that could affect medium-large dromaeosaurs in less arid climates.\n",

I mainly need it to driving a point straight home (not like it is that needed, the paper that describes the quill knobs on that genus is pretty good evidence for wings, but, still...). Again, if you have time. In any case, Deinonychus' height would be slighty higher if it adopted a more natural position that the crouching (or as so I see it, correct me if needed) one it is displaying in the chart. Also, do you think Aepyornis would be heavier that Utahraptor? Seeing that the model for estimating weights was deemed somewhat flawed, and that, at least in the chart, Aepyornis has a larger body, well, yeah...\n",

      "\"\"Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced\"\" This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.\n",
      "During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book \"\"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia\"\", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that \"\"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek\"\" .\n",
      "\n",
      "The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.\n",
      "\n",
      "On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga. There were hundreds of other missing persons. In the same period, as a result of Greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the Albanian population of Chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses a\n",

I did not say it was a single book, but what you linked to says it is a 'corpus,' and it is often published at once, though apparently there is debate whether it was all written by Zoroaster.  At least for what Zoroaster wrote, I think philosophy does play a part, mostly involving semantics (difficult; knowing esoteric philosophy helps to interpret spiritually/divinely inspired texts) as you described, but perhaps also with gematria, or as HPB wrote, perhaps with 5 other methods than these latter 2.  Since many esoteric mystics have consensus on philosophy, not the least of which is ethics, methods of interpretation are important.  For example, such mystics would say animal sacrifice in the Avesta should not be done but is symbolic of something, as it is thought to be in the Vedas, etc..\n",

Perhaps his behaviour deserved these intimate revelations, but that is not for Wikipedia to judge. Bloggers, tabloids and columnists are, as we all know, highly partial. I do not see how a Wikipedia biography can reproduce such intimate revelations without breaching the spirit of its neutrality. Btw whether the Winterton allegations are appropriate is open to question; reproduction of media speculation about unverifiable allegations does not seem to be within Wikipedia's biography guidelines.

As for the categories you mentioned, the first two don't have judgments of right or wrong or true or false in the definition. Hoax is different than canard because it does not imply that it's totally right or totally wrong. Additionally, hoaxes usually have a single or a few conspirators, when the antisemitic \"\"ZOG\"\" is alleged by several different independent groups. A canard and a hoax are certainly not the same thing at all. On top of all that, the use of the word \"\"canard\"\" is unencyclopedic editorializing. \n",
      "\n",
      " And just for the record, it certainly is a personal attack. Even if it's veiled as a summary of my contribution log (an inaccurate summary, mind you  I've written several articles and made the majority of my edits on topics that have nothing to do with ZOG/the holocaust/etc) it's still a personal attack.

I can only hope that, whatever doubts you had, they are now allayed.

If anybody ends up getting charged, it may well be David Igelasis for failure to do his duty as a sworn U.S. Attorney for political gain.  There are no 'alleged illegal activities' for Karl Rove because there is no charging document as in, \"\"Karl Rove is here charged with violating federal statute XX.22.XYZ.\"\"  Therefore, as I asserted way back in the summer, you cannot say, \"\"To date, no charges have been filed against Rove for his alleged illegal activities,\"\" since there are no alleged illegal activities.  No one in the federal prosecutors office is claiming Karl Rove has done anything illegal.  They were just angry that he defied coming in to answer questions which is his legal right to do.  He wasn't being charged with anything, therefore he did not have to speak with anybody. Then the prosecutor told the judge she was looking into possible criminal activity.  That changes the rules and now she is allowed to compel anybody in the Bush administration to come to answer questions.  Which she did and Rove showed up on time and answered every question.  Therefore, removing the weasel phrase that includes, \"\"so far no criminal charges have been filed against his alleged illegal activities,\"\" is correct.  You cannot say he has 'alleged illegal activities' unless he's been formally charged with a crime.  The investigation will die a quiet death because it was politically motivated to begin with and the prosecutor has figured out by now that she won't be getting a seven figure book deal or promoted to AG. \n",

While we take no position on whether such forces exist, they are simply not testable by scientific means and therefore cannot qualify as part of the scientific process or as a scientific theory.\n",

They claim that intelligent design should be taught in the science classroom as an alternative to the science of evolution. ID is essentially a hoax, however, since evolution is consistent with a belief in an intelligent designer of the universe and with an unlimited number of other metaphysical myths.\n",

However, Black can return the piece with a slightly better endgame after making White overextend his pawns, by 7...Neg4 8.e5 Bc5 9.exf6 Nxf6, and now White's best followup is to head for an uninspiring endgame with 10.Qe2+ Qe7 11.Qxe7+ Kxe7.\"\" THERE IS NO SOURCE FOR THIS CLAIM!!!!

It is not my job to point out that a specific ban, and bans are typically tailored to the situation, differs from the general, standard ban: after all, one of your initial complaints was that Tristan followed you to certain articles, if I remember correctly. An interaction ban is a two-way street, and what goes for the one mutatis mutandis goes for the other. If the shoe were on the other foot I'd have blocked Tristan.One more thing: you are free to list your complaints in essay form or with bullet points and emoticons, but not on Wikipedia. See \"\"Exceptions\"\" to WP:IBAN, though: given that Tristan is free to drop a complaint about you on my talk page, so are you; moreover, if you feel that this ban, you may do so, pace \"\"no commenting on each other anywhere\"\", by \"\"addressing a legitimate concern about the ban itself in an appropriate forum\"\". WP:AN is the right place for that. Moreover, if Tristan's behavior needs to be discussed because you wish to argue, for instance, that their behavior in combination with the ban makes your work impossible, I suppose that would fall within the purview of the exception as well (at WP:AN), but you'd have to be prepared to have your own edits, including the appeal/complaint, scrutinized as well.

      " \"\"No one can know how we feel if we do not say. We cannot expect to get understanding if we do not ask for it. No one will dispute that sometimes life's issues are too much for one person. It is fair to say that sometimes Wikipedia's problems fall under the same heading. This is a place where you can bring the bruises that can sometimes be got on this project for attention.\"\" Stress AlertsThe Stress alerts program aims at identifying users who are stressed, alerting the community of thier stress and works in tandem with the Stressbusters at trying to identify causes of stress and eliminating them. Note from the editorWelcome to this new format of the Esperanza Newsletter, which came about during the last Advisory Council meeting - we hope you like it! The major changes are that each month, right after the Council meeting, this will be sent out and will include two featured programs and a sum up of the meeting. Also, it will be signed by all of the Advisory Council members, not just . Have an Esperanzial end of March, everyone!\n",

Corner, a page that you tagged for speedy deletion under criterion G1 because of the following concern: Page is not patent nonsense. G1 clearly excludes poor writing as a reason for deletion. Also, you should almost never tag something for deletion if an admin already declined it (newly discovered copyright violations are the only exception). Please review the criteria for speedy deletion and especially what is considered Non-criteria. In future you should rather tag such pages for proposed deletion or file them at articles for deletion.

      "Yes, I am aware that there is no reference in the Australian Census about Latinos but this is trivial, there does not need to be any reference. You seemed to be confused on who actually is Latino and this seems to be your main point of debate. Going by your logic the pages Anglo-Celtic Australian and Black Australian should be drawn into question as they are also not referenced in the Australian Census. The rest of the page shouldn't need citations and references as no more information than what is available in the census is really given. And how exactly am I wrong? \"\"I'm not saying that your entirely wrong\"\" Again this opinion seems to me, to have come from your belief that I am not aware of what or who a Latino is, and in my opinion, no offense intended, is due to yourself not grasping the concept of a Latino. My view is further strengethed by your comment: \"\"I think it's dubious to list people because they're of Latin American descent all down as 'Latino Australian' when they are in fact of different ancestral, ethnic and national backgrounds.\"\"\n",

He was accused repeatedly of molesting young boys, and for a time was drummed out of the Theosophical Society on those grounds.  Mrs Besant saw to it that he was reinstated.  Particularly in the case of Krishnamurti, with whom Leadbeater was accused of child rape, it would seem impolitic to associate them in this article without some acknowledgment that there were difficult issues.  After all, Mrs Besant lost her own children in a not-dissimilar way to the circumstances under which Krishnamurti's parents lost him.  I met and talked to Krishnamurti in 1969 in connection with a film at his compound in Santa Barbara, California, and brought up the subject of Leadbeater.  He told me in no uncertain terms, and with uncharacteristic ill-temper, that he would never discuss that man.  All of this has been a point of public discussion for some time, and I wonder if there ought to be a further unearthing of sources for an article that associates Mrs Besant, Mr Leadbeater, and Krishnamurti.  kentfx\n",

      "Commenting on the evidence, I would like to assert which were done by me and which were not (I don't really know what to do, or what I can do, in these sort of situations, so this is all I can offer right now). Evidence 1,3,4, and 5 were done by me, and evidence 2,6, and 7 were not. Evidence 1 was me making an edit (logged in) to the page Aang, as I often make small edits to pages I am familiar with. Evidence 2 was not me, as I do not use profanity. Evidence 3 was me (logged in) following the guidelines given to me as I faced a block message, and the aforementioned guidelines were to paste a link on my page to remove the block. Now this is where I am a bit confused. Evidence 4 was me (NOT logged in) removing the Welcome! template that was on my user page, but I did this a few weeks ago (I believe that date listed is July 25). I removed it because I felt I no longer needed it and generally dislike it when my page is not edited by me, which I assume led to Evidence 5. Evidence 5 was me (logged in) removing the Unblocked message from my page, and although I do not know what \"\"snarky\"\" is (I hope it isn't an insult), I removed the template, again, because I generally dislike it when other people edit my page (I understand that in this situation the edit to my page was to alert me of the unblock, but I was assuming that message would be sent via inbox rather than a direct edit). As for Evidence 6 and 7, I am not user Hermanthegerman66, and I would guess that IP 24.7.247.203 is also Hermanthegerman66 but not at the library.\n",

There's no need to lecture me on wp, thanks for the offer tho - this is the first time that I have seen such aggressive uninformed editing in years. I was not at all trying to \"\"own\"\" the article, what I was trying is making sure that informed edits go through. In case you didn't notice, I previously asked for the article to be LOCKED for public editing, to lock out certain people (including myself!), to ensure that only a handful of people with a demonstrated background in aviation can review edits, while others could help with stylistic stuff and proper refs/quoting. At the end of the day, I have given up now - and I won't bother wasting any more time debating things here, as usual, interest will degrade over time and some jackass-type personalities will probably remove themselves sooner or later (probably the ones who just happen to be around accident-related articles because of recent news coverage) - at the moment, there's simply too much public interest, and what's happening isn't just a wp-specific issue, there's lots of layman's discussion taking place everywhere, without really adding to the quality of discussion. Finally, what's been happening here wouldn't be tolerated in a commercial environment with professional editors, where responsibility has to be assigned to individuals, encyclopedic or not. Again, this is nothing personal and against anybody here - I do realize that there are team dynamics at work here, and I have seen tons of editing wars going on here, not just due to my own edits - so I really don't take it personally. But I would hope for wikipedia to adopt some sort of policy, workflow and procedures for such \"\"hot\"\" events, to ensure a higher degree of QA - not just based on wp seniority/status, but based on people who have some related professional background. wp isn't going to fail obviously, but 5-10 years from now, the behavior tolerated here by some \"\"wannabe-experts\"\" will no longer be tolerated, and corresponding procedures will be put in place to differentiate between content and markup contributions.   \n",

      "\"Jackson didn't perform at the WMA because he can't sing at all anymore. That is the real reason he hasn't toured for a decade, along with his bankruptcy. Even his vocals on \"\"We've Had Enough\"\" four years ago were poor and he never had a strong voice to begin with, certainly not comparable with the real King, Elvis Presley. Jackson has had financial problems since at least 1998 due to his declining sales and popularity, as well as his inactivity and having to support all his siblings and parents. In 2002 it was revealed he was in debt to various international banks to the tune of tens of millions of dollars, and after losing those lawsuits in May 2003 he was confirmed as on the verge of bankuptcy with debts of $400 million. Invincible was a flop because it sold less than a third of his last album, \"\"Dangerous\"\", and it was thoroughly mediocre music. Almost all of Jackson's remaining fans regard it as his worst album. In 1989 Jackson made it known he had to be addressed as the King of Pop - a meaningless, self-proclaimed title. He even planned to buy Graceland so he could demolish it, which certainly says far more about Jackson's megalomania than it does about Presley. Half the songs on the Dangerous album weren't good, especially the unbelievably awful Heal the World, and it only sold 30 million copies on the strength of his previous three albums. Yeah, WJ was unique all right, but the less said about that the better. You must know some very sad 20-year-olds if they still admire the disgraced former King of Pop. Anyway, most people know him as Wacko Jacko. Justin is the real King of Pop and like Eminem he just doesn't want to risk offending WJ's fans. Justin will continue to perform, while Jackson's active career finished a decade ago. ( )\n",

It seems my judgement that the site is largely based on Nikki's personal experiences, and then a list of people who she knows to be pedophiles, but at some time or another have been naturists.  Her conclusion is that there is a causal link between nudity, nudism/naturists and pedophilia.  Her words are strong, and certainly her POV.  There is no backing with any research to support her point.  The net effect is that she smears naturists in general because of the acts of a few pedophiles.  I agree with her that the topic of preventing pedophilia is important.  But not her conclusion that we should disparge all naturists because of all the pedophiles arrested, some of them have chosen to involve themselves with naturisim because of their predeliction.  At any rate, the reason we have guidelines, such as Wikipedia:External_links#Links_normally_to_be_avoided, is to give us guidance in such instances.  \"\"Any site that contains factually inaccurate material or unverified original research\"\" seems pretty clear to me, regardless as to whether Ms. Craft was the original person who placed it here, or not.   \n",

      "I haven't found any source classifying (or even defining well enough to make a category) tools either. I think we might be best off creating our own definitionnot in the sense of original research, but purely for the purpose of better organizing the encyclopedia. Here's a thought (just a rudimentary idea): let's say there are passive and active tools. Passive tools create no tangible effectthese are measuring devices, ladders, flashlights, stools, clamps (unless they are used for crushing), jacks, beakers, tape recorders(?). Active tools have a tangible effect: drills, pencils, hammers, nail clippers, spatulas, shovels. In general tools act on a material (although not necessarily a specific material, like a flashlight will act on most things): pencils act on paper, egg beaters act on eggs, saws on wood or metal, caulk guns on caulk, paint brushes on paint, beakers on chemicals. So consider a container of correction fluid: the little brush on the inside of the lid is the active tool, the container is the passive tool and the whiteout is the material.

First Ansel Adams, in his three volume 1980 basic photography series, presented the Zone system this way and he explicitly said, in so many words, that his aim is not to force his own system of photography on anyone, but to encourage photographers to better understand their equipment in order to control the finished photograph. He disapproved of winging it, not of any particular system. The Zone system worked for him. And the Zone system is controversial, believe it or not. I know of at least one vocational school photography teacher (years ago when I lived in Montreal) who told students not to bother with it, and it seems he was not alone. \n",

Obviously Green Lantern or Robin are examples of a superhero name taken by several individuals, but the standard seems to be to create a 'main' article about the character name/legacy and give some details about each.  If more detail is needed/warrented, provide a link to the 'main article'.  Obviously this is also affected by the significance of the character.  Starman (comics) for instance gives descriptions of all of the many characters with that name, but only re-links to those individuals who have been notable using that psuedonym.  For Shadowhawk it seems as if the mantle of this character was passed cleanly from one person to another, so I'd say keep it all in one article as with articles such as Phantom Lady or Black Canary.\n",

      " I am somewhat confused by your statement that Astynax continues to promote Landmark as a religion. First, the use of the word \"\"promote\"\" is almost exclusively used in what would be considered a \"\"positive\"\" sense, and Landmark among others does not think of itself as a religion, so that description isn't necessarily \"\"positive.\"\" Also, as I think can be seen, the Human potential movement which Landmark is generally a part of is counted as a new religious movement, whose name strongly implies \"\"religious\"\" nature but only implicitly, and in fact est is listed in the List of new religious movements I helped put together based on the articles contained in encyclopedic sources on NRMs I found. So there is in my eyes no real reason for really questioning est's inclusion as a NRM. In response to  if you have any sources available to help improve the article, or which might be useful in determining which article we should use as the primary article on this topic area, any input would be more than welcome. So far as I can tell, Landmark has pretty much said that they were initially using the est approach, although they have admitted to changing it subsequently (I'm not sure how much, or if they've ever specifically indicated in what ways). So it might be that something like Landmark Forum or some similar title might be the best main article for the topic of the seminars as a whole, with specific information on the various groups and companies related to it in articles on those topics. Maybe. This is a bit of an active controversy around here, and the topic area has recently been reviewed by ArbCom because of its contentiousness, but if you have any sources availableor other input which you think might be useful we would all welcome seeing them.   \"\n",

Wayne and Lucian's personalities clash, and they rarely get along. Wayne has a friend called Dirty Joe (Lee Tockar), who owns a dump, and neighbour Wendy Winkle (Reverend Andrew Sparks) has a crush on him, but he hates her. Wayne's and Lucien's teacher is Miss.

Lucien enjoys science, nature and is a vegetarian. Lucian longs for a pet, but due to his mother's extreme cleaniliness rules, he is denied owning any.  Secretly, Lucien keeps a worm farm under his bed, that only Tony, Mari, Wayne and Wendy know about. It is shown in many episodes that Lucien has a fear of clowns. He has many skills, including knitting, and has shown interest in playing the harp. Lucien likes going to Soap City's only swamp (the only place he gets peace from Wayne, who is afraid of the place) where Tony lives. Lucien is technically the older twin as he was born first in the opening credits. Lucien Cramp is voiced by Kath Soucie. \n",

Wayne is obsessed with junk, which he collects and hides in his room; he spends most of his time at the junkyard, owned by only friend, Dirty Joe. Unlike Lucien, who loves the swamp, Wayne is terrified of the place, and also has a fear of frogs. Wayne is constantly annoyed by Wendy Winkle who has a crush on him. Wayne's only love is anything sugary, his main source of energy, and if he is deprived from it, he becomes tired and speaks nonsense. Wayne likes to give the impression that he's the best-behaved of the twins to his mother, and sometimes Miss Hissy, but in truth, he likes to manipulate to achieve his goals.

      "I must quote what Dominus wrote some time ago on my talk page when I translate I use \"\"Province of Lower Silesia\"\" etc. However, here on Wikipedia, I have to go with decisions made long ago. The problem is that Wikipedia is increasingly used for reference by people who are not translators. They should be aware that in \"\"real life\"\" the use of \"\"voivodeship\"\" results in confusion, as foreigners usually have no idea what this word means. Some Polish people may not care about it because Polish is a reader-responsible language, so Polish authors do not need to write understandably because readers are responsible for understanding. By contrast, English is a writer-responsible language, i.e. writers in English are responsible for making their texts understandable. (I wrote about the classification and some other problems related to translation in my article, pages 101-104). Importantly, this is reflected in the Wikipedia Manual of Style, as one of the five general principles of Wikipedia is Clarity: Writing should be clear and concise. Plain English works best: avoid jargon, and vague or unnecessarily complex wording. \"\"Voivodeship\"\" is jargon, understandable nearly exclusively to Polish people.\n",

It is a mechanism to advance the biological culture evolution. When individual discovers a good feature, the only way to spread it in the population is the recombination. Otherwise, you are stuck at the  clonal interference (situation where you cannot communicate information across the companies).

IMO, obscuring is hiding the things that put everything into the order, creating vaguesness and chaos.

      "Thank you very much for helping me out in my article on Chris Ojigbani. It was my very first article here and I learnt from your help. After I read your message that I should put more references, I put them. Later I noticed that one of the refrences I put may not be permitted because immediately a warning tag came on the article, saying I should use secondary references. That made me to suspect that the reference I picked from the website of Pastor Chris Ojigbani may be the cause of the tag. I put a reference from the ABOUT US of Ojigbani in the space where the article says that he considers his ministry is not a church. So I put that reference because in the ABOUT US, it stated his ministry is not a church. But when I saw the tag, I removed the reference and was able to see an article from a newspaper that states Ojigbani's ministry is not a church. But after changing it, the tag is still on the article. I don't know how to remove it. Kindly help check the article and help remove the tags, if okay.\n",

If you listen to sound clip for example, you'll hear a man from Peckham.  Peckham is not in the East End, instead it is in South London, and yet he is more Cockney than anyone I have heard in my life.  It says in this article as well that most characters on the sitcom Only Fools and Horses are Cockneys, and yet that takes place where else but in Peckham.  This article also says that Snatch contains Cockney accents and yet Jason Statham who plays one of the main characters in that film and seems to speak with one of those accents, is actually from Sydenham, in south-east London.    \n",

Well give me one scientific report that says humans are anatomically optimized to eat raw meat or at least a source that says humans are anatomically optimized to process cooked meat without aggravating any serious health-issues (see this)?

Like what is the acidity of human-stomach when food is inside stomach? and then you tout \"\"veganskeptic.blogspot\"\" as a reliable source for high-level scientific knowledge? Isn't it a tad silly to compare a Nutritionist who has been backed by the claims of other MDs and has a doctoral degree, to a random blogger? Where is the scientific journal that says humans are not herbivores? But when it comes to question your meat-eating ways, you cling to a random person as opposed to a slew of MDs who are cogently saying that the practice of eating meat is \"\"unhealthy\"\", \"\"unneeded\"\" and \"\"unethical\"\" (or something of that sort). Meat-eating is at best utterly redundant. I repeat, please show some credible scientific analysis of Human anatomy that firmly proves humans are purely naturally omnivorous (i.e. able to digest raw meat, or if not raw meat then any meat with good health), that's all it'll to convince me.

Stopping at 15 miles you don't even make it into Missouri, you barely make it across the Johnson County border with Wyandotte County. I'd be ok with a 15-20 mile statement, but my hang-up is you are still in Kansas Dorothy. Kansas City's Downtown is not 5 miles wide, so a more accurate range is needed. Maybe try 18-21 miles, cuz at 18 you've at least crossed the border. Yes, you can be in Kansas City at 15 miles, but you are not downtown, in fact MNU is only about 8 miles from the south part of Kansas City (take 135st/HWY150), but that is not downtown (and even further from the Kansas City International Airport). And I'm confused to why we will use the image from the institutional website claiming to the be most reliable, but yet third party site milage site is more reliable than the institutional website milage? Would not the institutional website be reliable for both? As far as 19 and 20 go... 19 is an exact measurement, and the word about was to suppose to give some leeway, as to make it an approximate of 20 (a nice even number) miles.

If we consider a \"\"gas\"\" as one model and an \"\"Ideal Gas\"\" as another then we can see where the two correlate (under what conditions they correlate). Whether they correlate more at \"\"sufficiently low pressure\"\" is fine but thats not what I'm trying to explain in the article. The model for an \"\"Ideal Gas\"\" has is own conditions and assumptions, thats the only thing I'm trying to display in the method of writing this article. Most people confuse the concept of an Ideal Gas and other simplifications of gases with the actual gas itself. Basically, I'm trying to have people say \"\"This gas behaves as an Ideal Gas under these conditions\"\" instead of \"\"This gas is an Ideal Gas\"\".

On 24 July, for example, a man dressed in white carrying a heavy pack, and accompanied by a woman appearing to be pregnant, came under suspicion. The couple was searched and the woman's assumed pregnancy proved to be a small radio hidden under her clothes. She used this radio for reporting American positions. Eighth Army tried to control the refugee movement through the Korean police, permitting it only during daylight hours and along predetermined routes.\n",

      "In the meantime, and pursuant to General Walker's order on the 11th, Colonel Murch's 2d Battalion, 27th Infantry, had been engaged in helping to clear the enemy from the area south of Yongsan. On the 11th Murch's battalion departed from its assembly area near Masan and rolled north toward the Naktong River. A steady stream of Korean refugees clogged the road. As the battalion pushed its way through this traffic a refugee cart overturned, exposing about fifteen rifles and several bags of ammunition. Approximately twelve North Korean soldiers disguised as refugees accompanying it fled across an open field.\n",

In one shot, we see Palpatine's face becoming the Sidious of the OT, followed by more lightning to the face. After a few close-ups on a conflicted Anakin, the camera focuses back on Palpatine, who is still in a transitional state but is lacking the details present in the previous shot. It is as if the Sidious face is showing through once as the lightning is interacting with the skin, and then fading away, and then finally breaking through again as the Palpatine face melts away and Sidious says he's too weak to continue. If Palpatine was indeed literally deformed by the lighting, why did his face go from normal, to Sidious, to semi-normal, and back to Sidious again. If the lightning wounded him, wouldn't the wounds stay instead of suddenly disappearing and re-appearing? Watch your DVDs, you'll see it. I have a few screen shots that I can provide to show you what I am referring to. By the way, both this and the regular Wikipedia article fail to make any mention of Sidious' strange voice after he rises from the window sill and before he puts on his hood. In the commentary, Lucas said he added synthesized effects to the voice to make the \"\"true Sidious\"\" drip a bit more menace.

      "I'm not an expert on free blacks in 18th-century Louisiana, but I do know that under Spanish rule, which began in the 1760s, slaves were given the right to own property under the law of \"\"coartacion.\"\" Slaves were allowed to get a fair price for the property they sold. They could use their free time to sell produce in the markets, or hire themselves out as laborers, nurses, craftsmen or artisans. As a result, slaves under Spanish rule, could purchase their own freedom, and could petition the courts for freedom. Therefore, the if the legal status of an individual could change, then a slave could become a freeman, and could then become a slave-owner. This was common. According to an article appearing in the Encyclopedia of Louisiana, by the end of the Spanish period (1803), there were 1,490 free blacks in New Orleans alone that had purchased their own freedom. So, I don't question the statement that there were free blacks trading in the Avoyelles area in the 18th century. I don't know who wrote this, and I don't know what evidence he has, but I don't know anything to make me doubt it. What evidence do you have?   \"\n",

However I seriously doubt the goal was only to gain a bridgehead, but rather to punch through the Panther Line, which the Soviets clearly failed to do.

I think my problem is that I am seeing this as an outsider to this UK group and the UK group might be seeing the article as a group of insiders writing for insiders.  My initial problem with the article was that it is unclear and allows different incompatible readings.  \"\"Administrative geography\"\" certainly makes the article more consistent, but I'm not sure it makes the title more understandable (unless, of course, you are a geographer or know all the branches of geography).  To benefit neophytes (perhaps I presume too much in thinking this is the intended audience of wikipedia and any other encyclopedia articles) on the subject which this article addresses, I would make the following suggestions.  1) Gut as much of the introduction as possible regarding the four countries and, instead, refer people to that article (since it already exists; which would also resolve some problems people have with repetition between these two articles.  2) Explain what \"\"administrative geography\"\" addresses (e.g., national and local government hierarchies) and how this relates to this article.  3) For the love of God, rename (to whatever is appropriate) the section entitled \"\"In the UK\"\" (or eliminate this title) because it serves no purpose whatsoeverperhaps to \"\"contemporary administration\"\" or something that transitions from \"\"History\"\"; although for reasons beyond my comprehension, some people are apparently wedded till death to that vacuous phrase (i.e., In the UK).  4) Move the last paragraph of the Intro (beginning with \"\"Historically...\"\") to the History section or exapnd on the themes it introduces. 5) Identify the referent of \"\"This structure\"\" in the History section (i.e., answer the question, \"\"What structure?\"\").  6) Follow strict style guidelines for the terms \"\"division[s]\"\" and \"\"subdivision[s]\"\" throughout this article if either is a significant concept for this article.  7) Incorporate the \"\"Parliamentary representation\"\" section into the section preceding it.  This would give a structure of [Introduction], History, Contemporary Administration (or whatever), Informal (Sub)Divisions, International (Sub)Divisions. As things stand, having a separate section for informal divisions suggests the rest of the article is about formal divisions, which would be fine if the sections reflected a more transparent and sensible organization to the article currently lacking.   \"\n",

      "I have requested the move based on Wikipedia policy and not google results which I have already indicated I lend no special weight to. But now I'll give you an example of why you shouldn't lend weight to them either, I  will also tell you why the results you have aren't at all reliable. Using the search term \"\"female genital cutting\"\" does not tell us the context of the result google finds. I'll give you an excellent example of this: I googled \"\"female genital cutting\"\" from 2010 to 2010, (link here:[]). I draw your attention to the 3rd result from the top (that is, the 3rd most relevant result that google could find across that entire year for that term), the title of this article is \"\"Sexual function in women with female genital mutilation\"\". Given that the title of this article clearly favours the term FGM, I opened the pdf that google links to in order to find how exactly the term \"\"female genital cutting\"\" was used in the article. This is the text I found on page 2 of that article: \n",
      "\"\"Worldwide, it is estimated that 100 to 140 million girls and women have undergone some form of FGM, and each year 2 million girls are thought to be at risk (1). The World Health Organization (WHO) classification is superior to terms used by the public or even some scholarly reviewed publications. The latter terms include female genital cutting, female circumcision, female Sunna circumcision, and Pharaonic circumcision.\"\"\n",
      "If the 3rd result on the first page of google scholar search is already a result which is refuting the use of the term FGC, then I submit to you that you can't rely on google scholar results (or ratios of results) as a method of determining whether FGC is replacing or augmenting the term FGM. Also note that the 4th result also uses FGM in the title, and that the 6th result is another which is refuting the use of the term. If stats are what matter, then I'll put that into numbers. 33% of the top results for the term \"\"female genital cutting\"\" for the year 2010 are refuting the use of the term female genital cutting.   20:52\"\n",

This all started as the results of edits by a \"\"new\"\" contributor, TDSDOS (who seems remarkably familiar with wikipedia editing and terminology) whose few edits thus far are mainly concerned with the status of the three countries of Britain (and a bit of Ireland). Then we have the unilateral creation of this category. Am I the only one who thinks this is more than fortuitous? Be that as it may, this new category is not acceptable and a consensus decision would also be needed for the logical alternative, i.e. 'Countries of the United Kingdom', if the need for it is proven and accepted.   \"\n",

I'm also curious as to what method you used to compare the sharpness, since I merely compared them side by side, and saw that in crispness, they're identical.  Again, yours is larger, but that's because I deliberately used a smaller image because the Fair Use Rationale requires that such images be no larger than (IIRC) 300px.  Yours is labeled 300px in the Fair Use Rational Template ts image page, but that label is incorrect, because right below the image it says that it's 400 x 600-something. We're lucky some other editor or bot hasn't come and tagged it as inappropriate because of that.  That's why I used a 300px image, so I wonder if that's what you're basing this on.  Anyway, I photoshopped your version to remove the blackness at the edges, and the green smudginess from the lower half of the image, to make it more \"\"gold\"\".  I also credited you on th e page to which I uploaded this newest version. I hope that's a good compromise. Thing is, since it's a modification of your image, it's still more than 300px, so let's hope we don't get tagged for it.  If we do, we'll have to put an Image Reduction Request tag on it.   \"\n",

      "No, Ketuanan Melayu was NEVER mentioned in the Constitution. It only mentions about \"\"Hak Keistimewaan orang Melayu\"\". This is nothing but just the mentioned \"\"Aborigin Rights\"\" just like most other countries, like Canada and Singapore. \"\"Ketuanan Melayu\"\" was invented, but I'm not sure when is it exactly that it was first being used. One may say it is a derivation from the Article 153, but it has gone too far from beneficial - it has been abused and being used as a tool by Barisan Nasional for their own gain. The rationale behind Hak Keistimewaan Orang Melayu is that what they claimed that Malays are the Aborigins (although I don't really agree with this, the Peranakans has settled in Malacca during the 15th centuries!) - the true Aborigins are none other than Orang Aslis. Let's assume that the fact that Malays are aborigins are true. Article 153 never introduced \"\"Malays First\"\" Policy, but rather the means to protect Malay rights as well as the rights of other races in this country. Article 153 is never controversial, but rather being ABUSED by certain politicians. I hope these makes it clear. The most prominent example that happens in this country right now is the government scholarship. You can read almost everywhere about this. Isn't this already an official discrimination? You can read more like the BTN courses who always refers the Chinese (include Peranakan generations) and Indians as \"\"pendatang\"\", but the fact is that Parameswara himself is a Pendatang, (and also Khir Toyo).\n",

      "Basically, the multi-propose Approval Voting we recently used, is designed precisely for that. Approve an alternative means approval, no vote to an alternative means oppose. The result gives that or those alternatives which have highest net voter number, just as Irpen wishes with \"\"approve & oppose\"\". The only basic structural weakness of Approval Voting (if voters are honest) actually is that it is not designed to register priority order of a voter and thus not whether an individual approve vote is strong or weak. But even this can be made by enlightened voters, they just need to write \"\"weak approve\"\" or \"\"strong approve\"\" when voting for any alternative - and the interpretation will be the task of the interpreter. However, what happened with the (yet ongoing) vote is not due to weaknesses of the voting system, but due to the problem that our subject is difficult to name in a generally accepted way. She simply is difficult. There are reasonable, sufficiently-well-founded arguments her to be placed under headings which almost all make some to oppose. And thus the vote splits. This being the basic situation, NO VOTING SYSTEM will ever cure it - unless using \"\"violence\"\". Of course a voting system could be designed which favors something and violates some others, and thus a decision will be made - against half of the population who are then totally pissed at.

However, it does not then follow from this assumption that, given A is found in the first envelope, the other envelope is equally likely to contain (1/2)A or 2A for every conceivable value of A (which is something we have implied in the subsequent calculation of expected value). \n",

      "Because, for any specific amount of money from which to fill the envelopes, given we have found A in the first envelope, for all values of A we can always find (1/2)A in the second envelope, whereas it is only possible to find 2A in the second envelope half the time.\n",

Nor is there any reason to assume that the urine flavor (presuming there is one at all) should be concentrated at the skin; given that the process of shark urination is an osmotic exchange, the urine should be evenly distributed throughout the system, and, if anything, *less* concentrated at the skin. \n",

      " Third sentence of the lead \n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, I was just perusing this article randomly and I have a suggestion for the third sentence of the lead paragraph. It reads \"\"Anatomical similarities, geographical distribution of similar species and the fossil record indicate that all organisms are descended from a common ancestor through a long series of these divergent events, stretching back in a tree of life that has grown over the 3,500 million years of life on Earth.\"\" I have two comments on this sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) First, it seems to me that the purpose of the sentence is to lay out, at the highest level, the independent lines of evidence in support of evolution. As such, I think that DNA (or genetic) similarities is a fourth line of independent evidence of the same level of importance as the three lines already listed in the sentence. Certainly, those three lines of evidence are the ones Darwin primarily relied upon when he laid out the theory (actually, he more apologized for the fossil record than relied upon it as an independent source of supporting evidence), but I think the incorporation of genetic evidence into the theory of evolution is at least as important a source of independent evidence and should be included in this sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Secondly, for both anatomical similarities and genetic similarities, it's not so much the similarities per se that are crucial, it's the pattern of those similarities. The article states later that it's the fact that these similarities can be classified into a hierarchy of nested groups that is key to their support of the theory of evolution. I understand the lead isn't supposed to go into all the detail that is laid out later in the article, but I still feel it's crucial to say something about how it's the nature of the similarities that's important.\n",
      "\n",
      "I might suggest: \"\"A nested hierarchy of anatomical and genetic similarities, geographical distribution of similar species and the fossil record indicate that all organisms are descended from a common ancestor through a long series of these divergent events, stretching back in a tree of life that has grown over the 3,500 million years of life on Earth.\"\" for that sentence.   \"\n",

The proposal to restore the old version is also very puzzling in light of the fact that it was a hopeless quagmire, as people repeatedly documented.

      "What's been going on here is people pointing out that there is legitimate and notable criticism of her knowledge of video games, that Anita does not meet notability standards as no credible sources (nothing even close to a peer reviewed journal) have praised her work, and a bunch of long time editors have said \"\"No criticism allowed because she awesome! Go away!\"\"\n",

      "The reason her work will never find its way into a psychology journal is because it is complete BS. There is a huge difference between toys made for boys and toys made for girls because corporations have done extensive market research and design to taste. It has nothing to do with a conspiracy against women that has been successful for thousands of years across every culture known to history. The fact that Anita wants girls to play games made for boys doesn't make her relevant, it makes her a fighter of reality, as well as a hypocrite.\n",
      "   \n",
      "She recently expressed her anger at video game makers for including female characters but used a bow on their heads to distinguish them, even though old school graphics left few options, and ignored the fact that modern video games are able to make females distinct in many ways. Yes, bows were used to distinguish females, because women are into accessories. They could have used, I don't know, giant hoop earrings. If Anita is as adamant as she claims, she needs to free her ears of the great patriarchy's brand and shave her head.\n",
      "   \n",
      "What about little boys who want to play with dolls and My Little Pony? They get teased much worse than girls who want to play video games made for boys. I guess that's because they're not manly enough, so it's still girls who are being oppressed.\n",

      "The idea that men and women should be treated equally in the workplace is one thing but the idea that men and women don't have fundamentally different tastes, and are the victims of an ancient conspiracy to convince us all that we do, is a bunch of BS that will never be taken seriously by any professional journal. This is why Anita is an irrelevant nobody (and proven liar: \"\"I love video games.\"\" I'm not a fan of video games\"\") and doesn't deserve a page beyond the incident where she played the victim and was given a bunch of money.

Just to clear some things up, I was not the guy who went \"\"India did not exist until 1947\"\". I would never post something as blunt, offensive, and ignorant as that. However, yes, I have changed a few things around as a correction. It is not to offend anyone, but like Kenneth Tennyson and his devoted sidekick JFD (the Green Hornet and Kato), I too have some historical points of views. I understand that you have been accused of being a pan-Indian nationalist, while I have been accused of being a Tamil nationalist.

Since this page on Indian Martial Arts effects us both, maybe together we can combine both our knowledge to present a remarkable page. Yes, I do understand our passions which may sometimes clash. However, if we could set aside some of that and work together in a \"\"give-take\"\" mentality we can make things work.\n",

      "Yes John is a TD however he will not need to stand for election during the next election circa 2012? if the gov lasts this long. John as Ceann Comhairle does not vote except in ties or have much to do except he is the speaker and his job is to keep control, and see to it that rules are adhered to. John has a casting vote in the event that there should ever be a tie in voting in the Dail, as nearly happened last week during a vote on Aer Lingus in Shannon which the gov won only by one vote, should that or any other vote be a tie John would have to cast his deciding vote which would most likely favour Fianna Fail. John will in theory remain a TD until 2017 providing he lives that long and that this current gov and the next government of 2012 goes full term. It was a stroke of genius by Bertie to nominate John as Ceann Comhairle as it will guarantee him his seat in the hotly contested South Kerry constituency which may merge with Kerry North to form a five seater representing all County Kerry. John is guaranteed his seat and it may eventually rid Fianna Fáil of the Healy-Rae Dynasty as Jackie (Highly Unlikey) or his son Michael would then be under pressure to retain the Healy-Rae seat in face of massive pressure from either Tom Fleming (unlikely) or Mark Daly (most likely) in a five seater the Healy Rae's would gather votes in North Kerry but either way they would be under pressure. If the South Kerry constituency is kept they would have virtually no hope because if Mark Daly who is from Kenmare runs he would erode the Healy-Rae home vote in Kilgarvan which is only 10kms from Kenmare as has close ties with the town. Coupled to this Mark Daly is a well liked auctioneer and a TV presenter with RTÉ and appeared on the RTE's Reality TV show Treasure Island in 2002. Mark Daly would gather a huge lot of John O'Donoghue's traditional votes and and the other Fianna Fail votes which went to Tom Fleming who out polled Jackie Healy-Rae twice but lost on transfers from FG and Lab. Either way whoever runs for FF is South Kerry next time is nearly guaranteed a seat most likely at the expense of the Healy-Rae's or Fine Gael.\n",

You drift into pure editorializing; this needs some other formulation that isn't a pure projection of your opinion and/or personal experiences. I happen to be a champion within the Waldorf movement of revising the emphasis on the eight-year class teacher period. But the opposite of \"\"brochure speak\"\" is \"\"antagonist speak\"\"; both may make statements that appear clear, objective and meaningful to the person making them - but are too broad and too vague simultaneously. It is \"\"weasel\"\" language; unattributed, both unprovable and undisprovable. \"\"  The percentage of teachers who make it through 8 years with a single class is staggeringly LOW - so what starts as a lofty goal often ends up as an interruption of the children's education - and often under difficult circumstances.  Making the claim that a teacher stays with the class for 8 years is brochure speech not supported by reality.  It's like saying - \"\"it is the intention of each baseball player to bat 1000\"\".  It is meaningless except for the purpose of sucking people into a set of ideals that aren't part of reality.  If you don't like the statement that points out the reality of the situation, then we should remove the claim completely.\n",

Yes, let's all just scare the parents into Waldorf education.  How about just saying \"\"rhythms during the day and through the year are thought to be important\"\"?

The curriculum attempts to awaken the child's will and initiative; the teacher has the responsibility for providing an environment that stimulates imitation. In Waldorf, such an environment is believed to support the physical and spiritual growth of the child. Formal learning is absent, and experiences of the written language are consciously avoided. Oral language development is addressed through circle games (songs, poems and games in movement), daily story time (normally recited from memory) and the range of practical activities.\"\"\n",

In fact, maybe you should point out schools who, as their goal, consider it best to surround children with something other than goodness.

      "Good evening sir, above article Ambarish Srivastava was nominated for deletion review on 2010 February 14. The result of the discussion was moved to main space. You have participated in that discussion. It was thoroughly checked and edited by you also. I am grateful to you for your kind support at that time. At present Mr. 'SpacemanSpiff' who nominated this article for AFD previously, has deleted its major part under 'poetry' section which was cited properly. As well as he also deleted it's whole 'Architectural works' section on Yesterday 19:01, 16 December 2010 and 19:03, 16 December 2010. I contacted Mr. 'SpacemanSpiff' on his talk page where he answered to me \"\"You can not use photographs of buildings as references for works by the person, we need reliable source references. Likewise, user submitted content sites are not valid references for poetic contributions and linking to every poem on such sites runs afoul of our external links policy. Suggest you read WP:BLP and WP:NPOV\"\". If that content was not was as per WP:BLP and WP:NPOV then why he could not deleted it previously when this page was moved to main space, while Mr. 'Fayenatic london' has made some quarries about it on 18:46, 20 August 2010, 18:49, 20 August 2010,18:53, 20 August 2010, 18:58, 20 August 2010, 19:05, 20 August 2010 & 19:12, 20 August 2010. He was satisfied with my answers about those sections. I request you to check it. Is it justified? if not please help it. Thanks a lot.   \"\n",

Currently, the amount of hydroxy gas (H H O) produced from water is very much relative to the set up of the system, the frequency used etc.  Various voltages, amperages and frequencies have been used to various degrees of effectiveness.  The cost is, of course, relative to the source of electricity used.  There are many people who claim to be getting extremely high (even over unity) returns by using the resonant frequency of water.  Regardless of whether these claims are true, this method should be given more than a cursory footnote, as it IS very simple.  \n",

As regards notability, clear the discussion about whether UGLE recognised the Rite of Memphis-Misraim in the 1850's clearly involved political decisions taking place in consequence of the Revolutions of 1848. Involving such key figures at Louis Blanc and Guiseppe Garibaldi, this is clearly highly notable people and events.

Could that possibly mean that 42% of \"\"Liberal SF\"\" residents are \"\"Gun Nuts\"\"? Please! The ban was even opposed by the San Francisco Police Officers Association, and Mayor Gavin Newsom refused to comment on it! As I mentioned before, EVERYTIME The Gun Ban was mentioned in the media from SFGATE to CNN, Chris Daly's name was tied directly to it as a key sponsor. EVERY SINGLE Google search you do on the ban will return an article which includes Daly's name. It's not like I'm reaching here at all, it is very clear that the section on the gun ban belongs in this article and that there is no valid reason whatsoever for it to be excluded..  \n",

      "Editors who engage in edit warring are liable to be BLOCKED from editing to prevent further disruption. While any edit warring may lead to sanctions, there is a bright-line rule called the three-revert rule (3RR), the violation of which often leads to a BLOCK.\n",
      "The three-revert rule states:\n",
      "An editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page—whether involving the same or different material—within a 24-hour period. An edit or a series of consecutive edits that undoes other editors' actions—whether in whole or in part—counts as a revert. Violations of the rule normally attract BLOCKS of at least 24 hours. Any appearance of gaming the system by reverting a fourth time just outside the 24-hour slot is likely to be treated as an edit-warring violation. See below for exemptions.\n",
      "A \"\"page\"\" means any page on Wikipedia, including talk and project space. A \"\"revert\"\" means any edit (or administrative action) that reverses the actions of other editors, in whole or in part, whether involving the same or different material. A series of consecutive saved revert edits by one user with no intervening edits by another user counts as one revert.\n",
      "The three-revert rule applies per person, not per account; reverts made by multiple accounts operated by one editor count together. Editors violating 3RR will usually be BLOCKED for 24 hours for a first incident. Even without a 3RR violation, an administrator may still act if they believe a user's behavior constitutes edit warring, and any user may report edit warring with or without 3RR being breached. The rule is not an entitlement to revert a page a specific number of times.\n",
      "If an editor violates 3RR by mistake, they should reverse their own most recent reversion. Administrators may take this into account and decide not to BLOCK in such cases—for example if the user is not a habitual edit warrior and is genuinely trying to rectify their own mistake.\"\"\n",

It was another editor who sought to distinguish \"\"civilised behaviour\"\" from that of Indians; my point was that even if one accepts such a distinction, non-Indians have committed absurdly large atrocities. In addition, I could have pointed to the Mystic massacre as a completely on-point example of a butchery that shocked our Native population.

IMO this is highly fanciful- if this is to be explained as an english corruption of a spanish word, how do you then account for the very many references in spanish documents of the time, to los Indios\"\" (the people) and \"\"las Indias\"\" (the place)? Surely native spanish speakers themselves would not get confused between \"\"indígena\"\" and references to the East Indies (\"\"las Indias Orientales\"\"). Whether Columbus really believed what he wrote about reaching the Indies, we can only speculate- Eratosthenes's relatively accurate calculation of the Earth's circumference was only one estimate amongst many, was not generally held, and AFAIK we've nothing to indicate that Columbus accepted or relied on this figure. | TALK 02:49, 2005 September 5 (UTC)   \n",
