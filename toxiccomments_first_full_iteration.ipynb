      "Oh I did read your comment. But I also read what you wrote before that and it is obvious you're trying to cover up your arrogant attitude despite your obvious ignorance of basic facts: \"\"Until you can produce a reliable linguistic source that has conducted more recent linguistic surveys in northern Greece, then Ethnologue is the most recent, most reliable source.\"\" and then \"\"I'm not sure what the \"\"howler\"\" is at the link to Macedonian that you provided.\"\" and then \"\"If you have an exact reference to it then use it to edit the number in the article (and include the reference) since it looks like a more recent survey. I'm not wedded to Ethnologue or its number, but it just required a reliable source with a new number to supplant the only other reliable source available.\"\" Even after FPS (for Pete's sake not some pesky Greek nationalist with a POV agenda) explains more than once that there was no census in 1986 and that Ethnologue's number is bogus you insist on talking about \"\"more recent\"\" and \"\"only other reliable\"\". So if Britanica (a far more serious outfit than Ethnologue) claimed that Greece had a population of 20 million according to the 1986 census you'd call that reliable even though it is an obvious error (both the magnitude of the number as well as the year of the census)? Learn to admit your prejudice causes you to make mistakes or stop bitching about the \"\"level of the attack\"\" any knowledgeable observer would \"\"initiate\"\". Better still stick to things you actually are knowledgeable about. As for my references if you actually read them you'd see that Eurominority counts villages with full or partial use of the language and V-PRC gives percentages (being sample-based). Neither agree with Ethnologue and V-PRC comes above the SD estimate.   22:23, 29 April 2009 (UTC\"\n",

      "So you wrote yourself: this article is more than just recognition. I write that it is also about illegal precedent... if not only about it. I myself comprehend the term recognition as a term which explains a process. Wiktionary for the english language for (Wikt:recognition) states as the first definition that it is an act or condition of being recognized, whereas wikt:recognize explains this transitive verb as To match something or someone which one currently perceives to a memory of some previous encounter with the same entity. So if we follow the literate meaning we could conclude that to make an act of recognition or come to the state of recognition one should match sth... ...with the same entity. What should should be matched here: eventual Kosovo independence with independence of othere countries. If there are some lists, which you mention, then there are lists of independent (or better nondependant) countries and other entities. Since there is a dispute whether Kosovo should be in one list or some other, some major (as in comparative of lat. magnus - en. bigger) thoughts could be given here. If you mention moving (from one list to the other, than you intuitively agree with me that there could be a POV that a process could exist, or not. Moving, by itself, is a dynamic category (Aristotel discussed this issue long ago), so it could be perceived and comprehended as a process. All this is much simpler (at least for me) to comprehend and explain in serbian language, since serbian language has svršeni and nesvršeni vid of a verb which adds to a bit more refined expression of thought, if I may be so language-subjective. Sorry if I offended you somehow, by quoting your words or in any other way, it wasn't my intention.

By saving tabs, any time in the future when you pull up the internet there is the tabs, and you can take up where you left off. On the newer version of 7.0, this action is not available.

On the old versions, by the search window (http://) is three arrows, one pointing to the left, one to the right, and one pointing down. This last one allows one to see recent sites visited, and one can choose one by looking at the list that is presented. This is time saving. However, on 7.0 version this button is deleted, thus costing one time. Also, 7.0 version is not compatible with Youtube download toolbar, and will disable it.

In fact, it's a rather odd suggestion - if arbcom members with strong feelings were unable to enforce the literal rulings of arbcom, it'd be a bit loony.  Eric was very very clearly attempting to poke the bear.  He knew he was under a sanction, and even if he thought it was a stupid sanction, he clearly and intentionally violated it to see if ArbCom was able or willing to enforce its rulings against him.

As he knows, I have developed the view that he seems to use the project quite persistently as a PR medium for the defunct corporation and its products. It is, I believe, to this end that, it seems to me, he has habitually fought against sourced material that brings neutrality and balance to articles on AMC products, e.g. AMC Pacer, Gremlin etc.  \n",

      "It is true that I was deeply frustrated by the apparent determination with which he misrepresented others’ contributions in order to justify their deletion, e.g. . I was also frustrated by his apparent insistence on idiosyncratic and erroneous interpretations of the English language, and also by what appeared to be deliberately erroneous interpretation of verifiable facts, e.g.   errors that cannot be permitted in an  encyclopedia.  \n",

      "My sincere belief that English was not CZM’s first language arose from the manner in which he uses it and the difficulties of communicating with him. (Examples on request.) I disagree that I belittled him for it – as a non-native English speaker myself, it's not something I would do.  Indeed I offered to help him with the language (offer ignored) and told him he could seek help from WP volunteer translators, so that he could write in Polish (also ignored).  \n",

Granted, I should not have let my frustration show. \n",

My posts encouraged constructive behaviour. \n",

      "Jayjg, is there any edit to this article you would accept? What are your objections to clarifying ethnic vs. religious definitions of \"\"Jews\"\"? The article is currently confusing as to which is which, and it would help to clarify that JfJ means ethnic Jews. I think in the case Mackan points out, \"\"many\"\" is appropriately used-many Jewish groups do see JfJ that way, but certainly not all (I would imagine there are plenty of Jewish groups without any official position on JfJ.) Also, most religions are rather fluid and change over time, and there is often debate over interpretation. It is, therefore, not quite so easy to state religious principles as fact (Jews don't believe in Jesus as Messiah? What about Messianic Judaism?) Of course, religious faith also tends to be given over to a lot of dogmatism (\"\"my way is the correct one\"\" type of thinking), so sometimes it's difficult to see debates to that as valid. WP:WEASEL does not object to ever using \"\"many\"\" or \"\"most\"\" or the like as qualifiers, it advocates against it only in the absence of sourcing. What we have here is a lot of sourcing, which does not, however, show that all Jews object to JfJ (as I explained above, that would be effectively impossible). It does, of course, show that \"\"many\"\" do (I wouldn't even object to \"\"almost all\"\" or \"\"most\"\"), but in order to preserve the plausibility requirement of WP:NPOV (JfJ's assertion that it is Jewish must be treated as plausible), it is impossible that all Jewish organizations disagree-as JfJ doesn't!  \"\n",

Here's how it happened: the fruity editor Benjiboi seeks to impose her queer agenda here at WP, i.e., to include anything and everything related to queerdom whether or not it's notable or sourced. Any editor who questions her edits, additions, ideas, etc., whether or not warranted, is branded a homophobe, or a homophobic vandal (whom she must \"\"fight\"\"). Instead of defending her work on the strength of its merits, apparent or lacking, she cleverly, and sometimes not subtly, transforms the issue to: \"\"if you're not with me, you're against me!\"\" And so the focus of the discussion here shifted from whether to include her work to whether Powers is a homophobe, and how dare Powers attack sick, tired Benjiboi. And this arouses everybody's sympathies for poor, poor Benjiboi. Yeah, now it's \"\"I'm on a break, I'm off to rest from fighting those (omnipresent) homophobic vandals.\"\" What's next?  \"\"My white count is way off (so give me what I want)\"\" or how about \"\"I'm throwing up my meds (so let me have my article)?\"\" Oh, and how commendable that she still edits here while on break from battle  what dedication!

      "It's kind of a moot point.  Another point is that as long as we are getting into particulars, naturopathic medicine is NOT a medical system.  Allopathy, Osteopathy, Chiropractic, even TCM are medical systems.  Naturopathy is a mixture of other medical systems but not its own system.  For purposes of law a naturopath should have a separate license or certification for every medical system employed.  So for example if allopathic blood tests or pharmaceuticals are used then a license in Allopathic is needed.  The license specifies that kind of practitioner for that type of practice.  TCM and Chiropractic are licensed in the same way.  Naturopathic doctors seem to be requesting an all inclusive license to practice any kind of medical system that they want.  Naturopaths do specifically have homeopathy as a medical system however homeopathy is nonsense and everybody knows it.  You would all do yourselves a HUGE favor if you got rid of that one practice.  Don't bother sending over the studies.  I've already seen them and if you don't understand what is wrong with those studies then you just proved my point about naturopathic students not coming from serious research programs.  Another thing to keep in mind is that we all know that the medical establishment has problems but that doesn't prove that naturopathy is effective.  This is a basic logic equation.  Those two things are mutually eclusive.  The medical establishment doesn't work because of all of the periferal garbage that keeps practitioners from being effective at what they do and not because the medical system itself is ineffective.  Western medicine if highly effective when it is allowed to work unencombered.  Another thought about naturopathy is that you should take some notes from the TCM people.  They want TCM tested by western scientific standards and the result has been that thier system of medicine has proven itself effective.  In areas where it has been proven ineffective, they are happy to acknowledge it as ineffective.  If Naturopathy did the same then homeopathy would out of the picture almost immediately.  The difference is that TCM practitioners know that thiers is founded in a belief system that over time has become an effective medical practice and where belief will no longer suffice, they are happy to scrap it.  The result, TCM practitioners are licensed at the masters level and the final stages of the OMD degree with full licensing nationwide is well underway with support from the medical establishment.  In fact they will have this licensing while you guys will still be insisting that homeopathy works.  What's worse is that you guys have been in practice for much longer than TCM has even been in the U.S.  Something to think about.  You have to answer the problem of not having a unique naturopathic system to test as well.  Therein lies the problem of being in a position of requesting an all encompassing license to practice anything and everything.  The practice has to be defined properly to be licensed and must be disinguishable from other practices.  It cannot simply be a combination of parts from other licensed practices.\n",

      "\"\"After the Soviet involvement in the Finnish Civil War in 1918, no formal peace treaty was signed. In 1918 and 1919, Finnish volunteer forces conducted two unsuccessful military incursions across the Russian border\"\"\n",
      "The Finnish doctrine is embedded in its first sentence, tying \"\"Soviet involvement\"\" in the Civil War  with the idea that it necessitated a \"\"peace treaty\"\", and then using this muddled logic as if it were an a priori justification for Finnish military incursions into Russia. (Russian involvement was perhaps half that of the German involvement and both together accounted for about 10% of the protagonists. 35% more Finns died in the Civil War than in the Winter War)\n",
      "Orthodox Finnish doctrine riddles the article, even though it contains all the information needed for an NPOV.  The account of Finnish independence for instance fails to mention that the Boshevik's policy was to grant autonomy, stating the event in heroic terms instead: \n",
      "\"\"The outbreak of the First World War and the collapse of the Russian Empire gave Finland a window of opportunity; on 6 December 1917, the Senate of Finland declared the nation's independence.\"\"\n",
      "Knowing the Boshevik's policy makes such doctrinal heroism ring hollow.\n",
      "To go through the article and cite every example of the bias and absence of references would take far too long but perhaps one or two more from various angles may make the point clearer. \n",
      "The article states: \n",
      "\"\"the Soviet Union changed its foreign policy toward Finland in the late 1930s. The Soviet Union began pursuing the reconquest of the provinces of Tsarist Russia\"\".\n",
      "Both parts of this need substantive verifiable reference(s).  What was this change? What form did it take? In what way can it be said that the new Russia was \"\"pursuing reconquest\"\"?  Is such a characterisation neutral?  The whole requires contextualisation as history is not a simple cause effect nil sum comic strip equation and there are many drivers for any situation.  In this case the pivotal role of the economic and political policies of the West towards the revolution in Russia (as previously towards the French revolution) need to be plainly set out.  However, from the implied assertions the article segues into a distortion of what would be the core issue imo for an NPOV article: \n",
      "\"\"The Soviet leadership believed that the old empire had ideal security and territorial possessions, and wanted the newly christened city of Leningrad to enjoy a similar security.\"\".\n",
      "The \"\"old empire\"\" is implied as being the driver rather than any legitimate security concern even though these concerns are in fact detailed afterwards.  \n",
      "It seems to me that the key aspect in understanding any of this is the socio-political concept of buffer states.  Again, the article contains all the information required.  It is just that it is presented in a non-NPOV form, and so ends up in the good guy/bad guy shoot out at the OK Corral story of the Finnish doctrine.  \n",
      "I believe that in the West, the establishment treated Finland as a buffer state, one that stood between it and the influence of the new socialism/communism.  I believe that Finland enjoyed the consequent economic benefits that flowed from this status, and which ended recently with the end of the Cold War.  \n",
      "When all these things are included and made overt, again adding nothing into the article, the following paragraphs can be seen as the key to understanding how the war broke out.\n",
      "\"\"In April 1938, an NKVD agent, Boris Yartsev contacted the Finnish foreign minister Rudolf Holsti and Prime Minister Aimo Cajander, stating that the Soviet Union did not trust Germany and that war was considered possible between the two countries. The Red Army would not wait passively behind the border but would rather \"\"advance to meet the enemy.\"\" Finnish representatives assured Yartsev that Finland was committed to a policy of neutrality and that the country would resist any armed incursion. Yartsev suggested that Finland cede or lease some islands in the Gulf of Finland along the seaward approaches to Leningrad. Finland refused.   \n",
      "Notwithstanding what was said at the time, history, in the simplest manner, seems to me to record its verdict on the two parties positions.  Finland's behaviour during WW2 merited her having to pay war reparations.  Russia's assessment of Finland's true position (and intent?) was vindicated.   \n",

      "Second, it is a well-established fact that RAMIREZ and Yepes invented his ten-string guitar. As I said, Bernabe was an apprentice at the Ramirez shop then, but the first Yepes-type ten-string guitar was a RAMIREZ guitar. Moreover, Ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra d'amor with multiple string resonators INSIDE the body of the guitar. This was rejected by both Segovia and Yepes as impractical. It was Yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only 4 strings tuned a very specific way (C, A#, G#, F#) alongside the normal 6 strings. You want a verifiable source? Here: Ramirez III, Jose. 1994. \"\"The Ten-String Guitar\"\" in Things About the Guitar. Bold Strummer. pp. 137-141. [ISBN-10: 8487969402]\n",

I have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact \"\"worthless\"\" because it disproves your ignorant (unconstructive) remark about Yepes' \"\"short hands\"\" being a reason for playing a 10-string guitar. Furthermore, Yepes frequently uses the 7th fretted (because it is the lowest string), but not \"\"frequently\"\" the 8th (as you mistakenly claim), which is a minor 7th higher than the 7th string. Moreover, these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by non-guitarist composers like Ponce or Rodrigo that are impossible on the 6-string (except in the edited versions). Being able to use open strings as \"\"crutches\"\" for a lack of technique was certainly NOT part of Yepes's entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar - though (I will add) many ten-string guitarists today (who are second-rate guitariats in general) have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. This has NOTHING to do with Yepes's own performance practice on his instrument. As someone who has studied for over a decade with one of Yepes's leading (long-term) students, as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the 10-string guitar, as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations, I can safely say that I know what I am talking about. Yepes even frets A2 and G2# on the 10th string rather than play them on the open A2 and G2# strings (5 and 9) in an example I have in his own handwriting, and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely MUSICAL and not about any technical limitations, which exist only in your imagination!\n",

If you cannot produce the source, then it's pretty clear you are engaging in improper original research, because you're argument boils down to 'look at the sign they carried in the opening ceremony' or 'look at the title on the IOC webpage', which is of course utter intellectual garbage if it contradicts things like the BOA's own explicit statement that Team GB is the Great Britain and Northern Ireland Olympic Team. I've no issue with you using IOC usage as the basis of a Manual of Style for various tables/articles etc, but in the places that specifically talk about the team name, or where the use of the BOA's own terminolology is relevant, but where you've been busily rewriting facts and removing sources you apparently just don't like, this is unnacceptable.   \"\n",

Thing is it was the US who passed legislation that attacked non-American ships using this route, i.e. the act that makes it so that preference is given to vessels sailing from American port to American port over those from a \"\"foreign port\"\" to an American port; this act was passed specifically to route the Yukon shipping trade through Seattle over Vancouver, even though it was Canadian/British waters that the route traversed. \n",

So far the problem is identified with Pettifer, so we put him aside and treat him and the authors pointing at him separately. To the Greek editors here, please use your own state archives to find where the Kolekas live in Greece and when did they live there. Or find their properties there, or some house, a single grave, a single piece of paper written in Greek by anyone of them. Or find when did they last leave from Greece please, or how many were/are they. I want to know. Find some church records (in Albania or Greece), get some proof so you can save face and make me shut up. How difficult can it be to find something Greek in this important man? How come all his children never left any Greek notes somewhere or are not part of some Greek facebook group? How come Spiro's daughter writes poetry books and articles in Albanian and not  single one in modern Greek language? Is this family really ashamed to be Greek or is it just (*drumroll*) not greek!

      "I honestly believe, and I've said this before, that there is a way of resolving this question. And the reason I believe it is because I believe that there has been a big misunderstanding about who Christopher Michael Langan is, and what he stands for. I would like to make two points.\n",
      "To be an advocate of something means to advocate for it. That is, it means to argue for it publicly. (One could be a private advocate around the dinner table, I suppose, but to argue this in an encyclopaedia would need very good evidence.) So, if somebody is an advocate, there should be clear evidence that he advocates the thing of which he is an advocate. Being an advocate means something different from, and something more than, being a member of an organisation. If it has been so difficult to find the clear evidence Langan advocates ID, that should give editors pause for thought, even those editors ill-disposed to the man.\n",
      "I believe the reason this evidence has been so difficult to locate is because Langan is not an advocate of ID. He is just not an advocatory kind of guy, if I may be permitted to put it like that. He is a very individual, probably very self-preoccupied sort of person. Contrary to how he has been presented, my impression is that he is anything but a self-promoter. He certainly is a guy who seems confident he is right about what he thinks, and would like people to listen to him. But that is not the same thing as being a self-promoter. More importantly, he comes across as somebody who is not at all interested in joining political movements, and is, in general, not a \"\"joiner\"\" of any kind. I truly believe that, as a guy totally outside academia, he was happy to receive the offer to speak at the ID conference, and could see grounds whereby what he had to say pertained to the interests of ID proponents. And the ID proponents, for their part, and as anti-ID people must surely recognise, are happy to accept into their fold anybody who seems like they could help the cause. So it was, if you like, a man and a movement taking mutual advantage of each other. Additionally, and as I have argued many times now, Langan's CTMU is disqualified from being a species of ID theory, because it explicitly disavows scientific proof, the very opposite of ID theory, which constantly tries to claim scientific testability. Langan, I honestly believe, is just not the kind of guy he has been taken for by anti-ID editors. And that is probably why the evidence just does not seem to be there.  \"\n",

It is more difficult to find a citation for opposition to use of the word \"\"transphobia\"\" than it is to find a citation for opposition to the use of the word \"\"homophobia\"\" simply because most people don't even know this word exists. Common sense, however, makes it clear that opposition does exist for the same reasons.\n",

It's always good to use edit summaries, of course, but it's especially helpful for proposed deletion, because prod tags are not supposed to be re-added once they are removed, and the easiest way to tell if a prod tag was previously placed on an article is to look at the edit history. Also, in this case, I marked the article for speedy deletion; when it applies, speedy deletion is better than prod, because it requires less attention.

I know the songs by Kylie that I made have not charted, won an award, or have been covered by any artists as stated by WP:NSONGS, there are a selection of songs I found on Wikipedia by really famous artists that kinda sits on the same boat as these articles. For example, articles Superpower (song), Rocket (Beyoncé song) and Rocket (Beyoncé song) by American singer Beyonce are well cover just like my articles but have not charted, won an award or have been covered by a variety of artists as stated by the criteria (maybe the music video significance allows it on the site?), alongside Who Am I Living For? by American singer Katy Perry. Also, some articles have charted like Double Rainbow (song) and Choose Your Battles by Perry or Carmen (Lana Del Rey song) and Money Power Glory by American singer Lana Del Rey are only provided by some of the albums information, reviews and sources rather than independent sources about the song itself, etc. Some of the articles I made, like \"\"Too Far\"\" and \"\"I Don't Need Anyone\"\" feature info about being released promotionally through radio airplay and proposals of being an official single. Also, the WP:NSONGS does say that those three criterias do not have to been needed but are afromented to. I'm not trying to make excuses, that is not my intention, but maybe you can help me out on this factor so I can have a clearer idea and mind on what I can do and cannot do with song/album articles.

As you may have gathered from my user page, I take a keen interest in lower league football teams. No offence to you, but I think this system is ridiculous. No matter how lesser known a footballer is, creating a page for them nevertheless benefits Wikipedia. The state of the lower league footballer pages on here is currently appalling, and if pages like mine keep being deleted, Wikipedia is going nowhere. There seems to be no reasonable explanation for why lesser known players shouldn't be represented. I'm from and live in England, but I don't see any reason why LOI players shouldn't have pages. In fact, others already do have pages which aren't being removed. \n",

Anyhow, to do my part, I replaced a section in the history part. I believe it gives a succinct account of the mandolin's origin. The facts- names, places and years- are footnoted. Afterwards, It became apparent that the beginning of the article had to be re-written since there was really no definition of a mandolin. So I did this (footnoted also). Now as for the question left in the sandbox regarding mandolinos and mandoras, I will leave it to another to rewrite the definitions and histories of those instruments. When that is done, there will be no need to add to the mandolin's definition to try to expain why it is different from these similiar instruments.

Second, it's not clear to me at all how (using which search parameters) the numbers were obtained. I tried to reproduce the search results using the search string \"\"wikipedia.org/wiki\"\". For the year 2009, for example, I get 533 hits if I search just the References sections of articles, and I get 820 hits if I search the whole articles. I didn't manage to get the 614 hits that are listed in the table for 2009.

      "1. Wikipedia Elective surgery states: \"\"Elective surgery is surgery that is scheduled in advance because it does not involve a medical emergency. Semi-elective surgery is a surgery that must be done to preserve the patient's life, but does not need to be performed immediately.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Medicinenet.com defines the term Elective surgery as follows: \"\"Surgery that is subject to choice (election)...As opposed to urgent or emergency surgery.\"\" []\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Medicinenet.com defines the term Elective as follows: \"\"In medicine, something chosen (elected). An elective procedure is one that is chosen (elected) by the patient or physician that is advantageous to the patient but is not urgent. Elective surgery is decided by the patient or their doctor. The procedure is seen as beneficial but not absolutely essential at that time.\"\" []\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Wikipedia Surgery states: \"\"Types of surgery: Surgical procedures are the commonly categorized by urgency, type of procedure, body system involved, degree of invasiveness, and special instrumentation. Based on timing: Elective surgery is done to correct a non-life-threatening condition, and is carried out at the patient's request, subject to the surgeon's and the surgical facility's availability. Emergency surgery is surgery which must be done promptly to save life, limb, or functional capacity. A semi-elective surgery is one that must be done to avoid permanent disability or death, but can be postponed for a short time. Based on purpose: Exploratory surgery is performed to aid or confirm a diagnosis. Therapeutic surgery treats a previously diagnosed condition.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus a reasonable person would conclude that non-emergency therapeutic surgery is a subcategory of elective surgery. Nearly all surgical abortions are NOT emergency procedures (in other words, they are scheduled procedures and are not medical emergencies).      \n",
      "\n",
      "It seems that this Abortion article's inartful use of the terms \"\"elective\"\" and \"\"therapeutic\"\" confuses the reader rather than clarifying important distinctions. One would use \"\"elective\"\" to describe a procedure based on the timing of the surgery. One would use the term \"\"therapeutic\"\" to describe a procedure based on whether there has been a diagnosis.  The 2 terms are not mutually exclusive.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If the terms \"\"elective\"\" and \"\"therapeutic\"\" are to be applied consistently (with no politically correct definitions for procedures performed on pregnant women), then virtually all therapeutic abortions are also elective procedures. Practically speaking, in nearly all modern situataions the 2 terms will be mutually inclusive because modern medicine considers the satisfaction of any woman's desire to no longer be pregnant (regardless of the reason why she no longer wants to be pregnant) as \"\"therapeutic\"\", and abortion is virtually NEVER performed under emergency conditions (in other words: there are virtually no occurences in which an abortion must be done immediately to avoid a serious health risk).   \n",
      "\n",
      "The current section of this article called \"\"Induced\"\" [] contains a false dichotomy when it states: \"\"Reasons for procuring induced abortions are typically characterized as either therapeutic or elective. An abortion is medically referred to as a therapeutic abortion when it is performed to: ... An abortion is referred to as elective when it is performed at the request of the woman \"\"for reasons other than maternal health or fetal disease.\"\". \n",
      "\n",
      "This false dichotomy should be corrected by helping the reader understand that the 2 terms therapeutic and elective are virtually synonymous, rather than leading the reader to incorrectly think that an abortion is EITHER elective OR therapeutic. Rarely will any therapeutic abortion not also be elective.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, using the term \"\"therapeutic\"\" also implies that the condition of being pregnant is a disease or a health defect, when in reality, absent any political use of medical terminology, pregnancy is a sign of a healthy reproductive system and is never a disease. There are extremely rare occassions when organs of or near the reproductive tract are diseased and an abortion could thus be therepeutic to the gravid woman (though fatal to the fetus). \n",

Remember that *any controversial unsourced material* will be challenged and removed as per WP:Verifiability. Now, that everyone knows that, we can hopefully start a sensible and reasonable discussion on Seoul again. I will start with pointing out some very basic mistakes here:\n",
      "The reference everyone seems to quote  has no mention of this invented system called \"\"Seoul Subway Line 1-9\"\". Strictly speaking, it lists lines owned by Seoul City's government. \n",
      "That reference also says that Line 7 extension to Incheon is to open by late 2012, which it did. Since it is outdated, the true number is 327km.\n",
      "Gyeongchun has no grade crossings (Terra is still remembering the now passed away Gyeongchun line from the 80s) and will never have KTX service (which he is again confusing with Wongju-Ganneung Line, a separate line under construction exclusively for HSR)\n",
      "Gyeongbu Line for the metro service of Line 1 operate on a separate track, hence no track sharing. \n",
      "Gyeongin - Are you kidding me? Freight and intercity trains? Where is that nonsense coming from? This is an exclusive metro line with no other traffic whatsoever. This line is metro exclusive. How old are you? I mean like you seem to remember Seoul from the 80s or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I have addressed the issues above assuming that track sharing is not allowed, which is an invented original research as raised by BsBsBs. Looking back at the sources..neither APTA nor USDT make any mention of that. The 2011 UITP source does mention something similar to it in a footnote saying that \"\"networks that are functionally separate from the rest of the rail system\"\" are basically metros from what I understand. Now remember they say \"\"functionally\"\" - not \"\"track sharing\"\". That's because the Korean government's legal law defines Line 1's Gyeongbu section for example, as a metro because it has a dedicated track on its own that follow the same path as the intercity trains next to it. In other words, it is functionally separate from the rest of the railway system and hence meets UITP's definition, which is very Eurocentric by the way. Seoul Metro and SMRT are members of UITP, so clearly track sharing is absent from their definitions. But functionally separate is present. And this is exactly how things should be done. And this 10 minute rule is completely absent anywhere in UITP/APTA or USDT and was voted out by consensus by multiple users (except IJBall). Legally, Incheon Subway is part of the metro system, so there's no doubt in including that as I have mentioned before with the legal sources. From what I know, Korail will be completely updating their website on April 1st, with the new updated data for their subways. So we will have direct numbers for all of Korail's metros pretty soon. The issue of sorting metros by systems and not by operators, is something that is not agreed with here. It would require a name change on this article. This will need external consensus and is something we will deal at a later time.   \"\n",

Now from Harvard University  basic required courses are an introductory course and one each from 1. Logic, 2. Contemporary metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, 3. Ethics, political philosophy, aesthetics, and 4. History of ancient, medieval, or modern pre-20th-century philosophy. Stanford University  basic required courses are an introductory course and one each from Logic, Philosophy of science, Moral and political philosophy, Metaphysics and epistemology, and History of philosophy. Major research universities seem to agree that all undergrad. phil. majors must take a logic course (and, incidentally, that metaphysics and epistemology can be lumped together at this level). While what undergrads. must take is hardly the be-all and end-all of phil., it certainly indicates to me that logic is a major area in the minds of academic philosophers. I also consider \"\"The Development of Logic\"\" by Kneale and Kneale  to support this position; from pg. 1 it puts \"\"not simply valid argument but the reflection on principles of validity\"\" in the context of Plato and Aristotle. (Of course they also discuss it in the context of math.) I contend that logic is a central area of phil. and merits conclusion alongside ethics and metaphysics/epistemology as the three major areas of phil.  \"\n",

      "The first question you need to ask yourself is, \"\"do I have a history (perhaps as yet unadmitted) of being overly critical of myself?\"\" If the answer to this might be yes, then you can't always trust your own tendency to self-criticize, because your subconscious motivation is not self-improvement but self-denigration; don't pay that too much heed then. If, however, the answer is no, then if you notice a behavior of yours that bothers you, listen to the notice, and decide cognitively how much it really bothers you or should bother you. Sometimes we only notice what bugs us about ourselves by trying to observe ourselves objectively. You might be doing that, and you might do well to listen, but it's hard for me to weigh this. As for my own opinion, looking at Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 December 11#Abortion, you haven't added anything that was redundant, so I wouldn't say it's an issue. If the discussion gets long and people keep bringing up things that you've already answered, remember that the closing admin is going to read everything and they should notice if you've already answered a repeated objection. Then it's a question of how much faith you have in the admins (I know, I'm treading on very thin ice now). For instance, I made sure to answer everything at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Faith Freedom International because I wanted to be absolutely certain that if the article did get deleted, I couldn't blame myself for not trying everything. I'm likely to do the same thing at Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2006 December 5#Ali Sina if anyone opposes the citations I've dug up. But my motivation here is dedication to freedom of speech and for less critical articles I leave my comments for the admin and let it go. A rule of thumb that you should know is that if an article is up for deletion and 80% of the votes are keep, it will probably be kept (even though it's \"\"not a vote\"\").

      "Please note that all I have done is replaced incorrect information restoring well-documented information that someone replaced without citing sources and providing incorrect information. Note that wiki commons has archival information with the deceased person's [Jan Karski's ] hand giving the date of birth primary source, which I posted. Moreover the two articles in Polish cited notes explain the problem with the birthdate controversy.  Finally the executor of the estate Pawel Zalewski is no longer alive and the rights to the deceased legacy are with his closest relatives.  Jan Karski's family, niece and goddaughter Wieslawa Kozielewska Trzaska cited in my version gives the correct birthdate and she has legal rights over decisions involving her famous uncle.  If you would like to receive a letter from her legal counsel about this issue, please let me know where it ought to be sent. It shall be done. Note that in addition to the sources cited, two official biographers Thomas Wood and Waldemar Piasecki use the date I cited as Jan Kozielewski's nom de guerre Jan Karski's birth date.  I don't know what I ought to do to correct this error.  Note that similar confusion occurred in the Polish version of wiki and after edit changes back and forth, they were  persuaded by the articles cited that the correct version was the one I included.  I appeal this decision to a higher editor.  This is a a serious error since this year is the karski centennial and your wiki error is creating much confusion.\n",

Other headings might include Congenital Heart Disease, Valvular Heart Disease, Cardiomyopathies, Dysrhythmias and Conduction Abnormalities, Diseases of the Coronary Arteries, Diseases of the Pericardium, Diseases of the Aorta and Great vessels, Brachiocephalic and Cerebrovascular Disease, Other Peripheral Vascular Disease, Arteritides, Systemic Hypertension, Thrombosis and Embolic Disease, Other Venous System Disease, Diseases of the Pulmonary Vasculature, and Heart Failure and Transplantation.

My inclination (off the top again) would be to handle this aspect bottom up, e.g. \"\"behaviour of dromaesosaurs\"\", \"\"behaviour of large tyrannosaurids\"\", \"\"behaviour of Jurassic sauropods\"\", \"\"behaviour of large late Cretaceous ceratopsians\"\" (bound to be different from that of smaller, earlier ones because the big, late ones had horns). Even working out how to structure a set of articles on this topic probably needs input from people with knowledge of specific groups / periods. But I'm game for it, as I think structuring a large set of related articles is a current weakness in Wikipedia (I'm involved in an attempt to remedy that in 1 subject area, History of IBM mainframe operating systems, see the Talk page). \n",

So I edited in Jan 2007 and my edit was reverted almost instantly. My current impression is that a certain clique thinks it owns that article and would rather revert edits not controlled by them than see the article improved by someone who's not a member of the clique and / or who (in the earlier instance) interprets Wikipedia guidelines differently from them.

Any inhabitant of Ireland who assisted with information given to the British was an informer.\"\" She avoids my earlier point.

The reason is, the \"\"old\"\" view is still widely held and valid, the US certainly did drop the bomb to end the war quickly - it may have also had other motivations, which are now coming to light, which adds to a more nuanced picture of events. There will always be new perspectives and theories, just like in Decline of the Roman Empire, but these are not really revisionistic. Revisionism, strictly speaking, is where you take an established idea and discount it based on new evidence.  Otherwise it is just the normal process of better understanding the many nuances and complexity of history. So I guess the question is, is there a school of thought saying the US did not drop the bomb because it wanted to end the war early?   \"\n",

      "sources please for the word \"\"wrongly\"\". Even if there are sources this cannot be written down as fact. I am aware that most (or many) devotees would disagree with Kent, but Babb disagrees with the viewpoint of the devotees on  page 174 of Redemptive Encounters he writes that \"\"this cult [is] deeply and authentically Hindu\"\".   \"\n",

No mention of the Bible, no mention of justification, nothing else Protestant. All that is known about Helvidius is that he did not believe in the Virgin Mary.  That doesn't exactly make him a Protestant. Identical is laughable - there is no evidence to back up such an assertion.

      "This becomes even more obvious when we consider the fact, that the Waldensians, the Lollards and the Hussites joined the Reformation and often mixed with various Protestant groups. The Waldensian Church, still existing in Italy, is considered a Protestant group and not a sect, as User:Secisek tries to imply. This is because all key beliefs the Waldensians have professed since the 12th century are common to most Protestant groups and are different from those professed by sects considered heretical by both the Catholics and the Protestants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whoa, I did not imply they were a sect, I wrote that they were. I intended no offense with that word. The Waldensians were a sect, and they revised their doctrine at the Reformation to conform to the new Protestant thinking. This is taken from the Waldensian's article:\n",

Moreover, the Waldensian absorption into Protestantism led to their transformation from a sect on the edge of Catholicism that shared many Catholic beliefs into a Protestant church adhering to the theology of John Calvin, which differed much from the beliefs of Peter Waldo. From that moment the Church became the Italian branch of Reformed churches.\"\"\n",

Many scholars have used the term proto-Protestants in their articles, although there do exist historians who argue that the term should not be in use for various reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact is, they have altered their key beliefs - that is what made them Protestant.\n",

      "The problem is, however, that the Catholic historians often argue against the term to show that Protestants appeared only in the 16th century, while before them, there was just one Church of Christs and many small sects. For this reason even Waldensians, now considered a part of the Protestant Church even by the Church of Rome, are called a sect by Catholic historians. This dychotomy is absurd, as it implies that the Waldensians were at first a sect and then a Protestant group, while they have never changed their beliefs in the course of History. If the Waldensians are Protestants now, and they maintain the same views they professed in the late 12th century it means, that they have always been Protestants, even when the term had not been in use.\n",

      "Hello Mareklug. Well, I believe that your request at WP:RFPP might have been declined due to the fact that the edit war was just starting and there was thus insufficient information of a full scale edit war that would have surely resulted in full protection to the article (by the way, that's how we call it: we don't \"\"block\"\" articles, we \"\"protect\"\" them). If the edit war continues, then do relist your request at WP:RFPP. It will likely to be accepted. I also have to agree that you might have failed to control yourself sometimes, when in the face of your opponent Tocino. Edit warring is never a good choice, as it only worsens a dispute and can indeed grant blocks to both of you (although I think that a topic ban would be quite an unlikely/draconian measure, you're not causing that much trouble as far as I see). My suggestion is, when Tocino (or any other user) makes an edit that you strongly disagree with, refrain from reverting right away and instead, summon the other party to the talk page. Then two things may happen: either he joins the discussion so you can both argue your points of view, or he doesn't join the discussion and provides you with a good reason for requesting an administrator's intervention against his unilateral actions. I hope this helps. Best regards, nd \"\n",

I'm a reasonable and civil professional. Address me in a civil tongue or don't address me at all. Second of all, I'm of English and Spaniard descent who is sensitive to the falsehoods thus far stated in wiki pages concerning the English and Spaniards. For example, one of these falsehoods covers the notion that the Welsh population is huge in Argentina when in reality it is not as significant at all in numbers as the author of the 'Argentina' piece makes it out to be. Another false notion within the same piece - both explicit and implied - is that Italians are the majority ethnic race in Argentina, when again, the numbers show this is not the case. These and other idiocies which aren't true exemplify the need to update the info therein. Third of all, I read your bio. With all due respect, according to your ethnic background, you're not qualified to dictate the origins of other nation's histories, especially Euopean. I know my English and Spaniard history. You don't. I may sound like I'm talking out of line here, but seriously, I'm not. Don't take offense as I state the facts as I see them. This is why modification is necessary. There must be an appeals board within Wiki to whom I can supplicate my case. I hope that you understand my position. I look forward to making wiki a fair and informative base of knowledge. With your help, we can progress to this goal. Thank you.\"\n",

      "It's surely not intended as a JavaScript tutorial, but you see, you can't really discuss a programming language without delving into it's syntax. Is this a bad thing? I don't think so - there are a lot of misconceptions about JavaScript (many of those are caused by bad tutorials on the web) and we can eliminate those by presenting a clear picture of the language. I've seen the statement that \"\"JavaScript doesn't support private members\"\" too often to be funny - even on this page before I edited that out. Stating in the article that JavaScript supports private members eliminates this misconception, but you need a code sample to prove your point. Since people can actually see with their own eyes how it works this adds to the credibility of the article. So you want to discuss closures? If you don't mention them, the article fails to mention one of the defining properties of JavaScript. If you do mention them, the shortest and cleanest way to explain the concept is through a code sample. As long as we structure the information in an appropriate way we need not necessarily be afraid that we've got too much of it.  \"\n",

They can only send a few out of earth orbit (where they have no ability to generate income like earth sattelite spacecraft) every so often. For various reasons they place the few spacecraft that can be afforded in equatorial orbitsmainly because they can't afford to send out 1 spacecraft for each planet, so they have to keep the sattelite orbiting in the solar plain so it can be sent to another planet later. From equatorial orbits there is only one way to take a picture of the polesfrom the side! Even though the picture looks like it is one shot from the top, it is actually several shots from the side and put together to make it look like its one shot from the top. In order to make it look like its taken from the top, they have to correct for the fact that its actually taken from the side. The very top just becomes a gross stretched out mess. \n",

Now click 'edit this page' and in addition to the normal edit box you should also see a warning at the top that you are editing an out of date version of the page. That's OK, in this case it is what you want. Don't make any changes to the text, just enter an edit summary like 'reverting to last good version by xxxx' or 'rv test', press the 'save page' and you are done.\n",

You can get a similar page by clicking the 'diff' link from your watchlist. Then clicking on 'Revision as of 22:15, 9 September 2005' at the top of the left panel, will take you to the earlier good version, and you can make a null edit and save as before. The advantage of using this page difference approach is that there are also links to go forward and back to newer and older edits. So if a vandal has made a series of bad edits you can keep stepping back until you reach a good version of the article before editing and saving to revert to that version.\n",

Typically if a user has recently had one of the earlier test warning, you add the next one in the sequence and sign it. However, if you are reaching test4, its a good idea to get an admin involved because the next step is to block them.\n",
      "If you have the time, you can also check the user's other contributions to see whether they have been messing up any other pages, and if they have, revert those pages too. However, if they look like being a particularly busy vandal, its usually best to get help from an admin at Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress, because admins have some extra 'rollback' buttons to make it much easier to undo a large number of changes.\n",

Conversely, the \"\"Bible version debate\"\" (or whatever it's named) should reference the general dynamic/formal discussion, but should focus on Bible-specific issues, and identify the OTHER issues specific to translation of the Bible.

      "Um, the Georg Blume quote obviously implies that he was inquiring about the reason for the riots. James Miles was there to report on the riots, so he would ask questions pertaining to the riots. If they actually wanted to separate, I can tell you right now that, logically, they would've TOLD THEM they wanted to and would say something to the effect of \"\"FREE US, WE WANT TO SEPARATE\"\", but they did not. They just explained their issues, which were socioeconomic and ethnic issues. In addition, James Miles states: \"\"The rioting seemed primarily an eruption of ethnic hatred.\"\",which I'm guessing he had to interview many rioters/residents to ask them about it. And rather, I don't think the Rodney King article is worded very well- it should be changed, but I'm guessing many people are already well-informed of the real reasons for those riots, unlike this riot where few seem to understand- including you! And, come on now, you're obviously just picking at straws to try to twist the article. All evidence so far points to the rioters looting and beating ethnic Han chinese out of hatred, not because they want to separate or they would've attacked much more government buildings rathern than focussing on the stores of more wealthy Chinese people. Right now, the article is pretty neutral as it already explains both sides and I hope people keep it this way.216.252.71.154  \n",

      "Your closure of that ANI report is unwise at best, abusive at worst. Ample evidence of wrong doing has been provided, maybe not with respect to the BI sanction (but even that is not clear cut, given it is meant to be broadly construed), but definitely in the sense that these edits are clearly the same terminology policing behaviour that led to that sanction, but on a slightly different BI related term. Action is clearly warranted. Archived or not, as I said, I am not going to let this lie, I will be informing Cailil when he returns. In addition to sanctioning Highking, I expect he will want to take issue with you disrespecting him by completely ignoring all the effort he went to in detailing exactly what is wrong with HighKing's behaviour, and what he should be avoiding. Who I am is completely and utterly irrelevant to whether or not HighKing is ignoring those warnings and engaging in the beahviour Cailil described as being not wanted here. He even made that exact point to HighKing - while Cailil has sympathy with the so called harassment he often claims to be suffering as a way of avoiding sanctions for making these edits, Cailil was crystal clear on the point that who reports him, or even just the mere presence of suspect accounts in any of these reports/disputes, has absolutely no bearing on whether or not he will act on any poor behaviour he observes from HighKing. I know he has previously expressed frustration at seemingly being the only admin here who is prepared to deal with HighKing, and I can see why with actions like this. Your closure of the section simply because of who the complainents are has only one effect - rewarding HighKing for bad edits. It's really no skin off my nose, is it? If I am a banned user, do you think archiving that discussion will have any effect on me? Or if I am not banned but this is just not my main account, then do you think archiving the section is going to change whatever reason I might have for not posting there with my main account? Of course not. The only thing it achieves is to remove from sight as an immediate issue. Which, given the fact Cailil was at pains to point out that HighKing's poor behaviour stretches back to 2008, is not a good thing for Wikipedia. You're an admin. You're expected to deal with long term problems, not sweep them under the carpet for wholly irrelevant reasons. If HighKing were ever to end up at arbitration for example, do you think he would escape sanction for persistent WP:TE behaviour, simply because other people involved were not following some completely unrelated rule like WP:SOCK? Of course not. Hopefully you can at least appreciate that as an admin, you being the person who maintains that cycle of WP:TE, is not only bad for Wikipedia, it's a form of laxity that really isn't excused by who I may or may not be. It also had the material effect of me not being able to correct Murray on a basic point of fact, meaning the archive now has errors in it, which I am sure is not the intent of that facility. Archive or no archive, at the very least, if, or more likely when, Cailil sanctions HighKing for those edits, I expect you to hold your hands up and admit your failure to do your duty as an admin in this case. Anything less will simply fall well below the expected standards of admins on Wikipedia. Anyway, I've probably spent far too long typing a post that you will most likely just ignore and delete, so goodbye for now.\n",

Simply because countries that are rated \"\"free\"\" by Freedom House are generally more supportive of United States interests does not mean that Freedom House's rating are generally associated with United State's intersts.  After all, the long-time US ally Saudi Arabia is treated very harshly by Freedom House.  The summary of the Heritage foundation report does not accurately reflect the assertions in the report which in fact states the opposite, \"\"As nations become freer, both politically and economically, the policies that they consider to be in their interests become more closely aligned with policies championed by the U.S.not because they are U.S. policies, but because they are policies consistent with the interests of free societies.\"\"  This means that the verification for that statement is not valid.  In addition, even if it were quoted accurately, the Heritage Foundations stated goal is to \"\"formulate and promote conservative public policies;\"\" they are not a neutral source.  (Indeed, most of the sources for this artical are not neutral sources but are sources with strong bias one way or the other.)  Citing other's opinions, while they are verifiable, does not make them neutral.  \n",
      "2) BruceHallman is correct, however, in questioning Ultramarine's suggestion that the test of if something is valid is if it reflects how Freedom House describes itself.  Freedom House itself is not a neutral source, and while they may be a good source for some parts of the article (such as when they were founded or who the chairman of their board is) descriptions of their ideology, goals, etc. should probably be cited as \"\"Freedom House's states\"\" etc.  Simply because Freedom House doesn't describe itself a certian way doesn't necessarly mean that it isn't valid.\n",
      "3) Saying that Freedom House is \"\"generally associated with US interests\"\" isn't necessarly a critisim; however, it is not a statement of fact, either.  Merely the fact that it has been debated so much on this talk page indicates that it is not a verifiable fact, but rather a matter of some contention.  I will outline how I think the article could be better constructed to include the differing opinions of Freedom House in the next bullet point, but I think that the introduction should probably be saved for things that are clearly true, and not things that are up for debate.\n",
      "4) I feel that if the article is restructured slightly and the primary editors of this article (which, lately, seem to be BruceHallman and Ultramarine, who clearly have different views of Freedom House as an organization) could agree on this structure, it would save a lot of debate.  I think the introduction of the article should state basic, verifiable facts (What they are, where they are headquartered, where they are located, and the fact that they are best known for publishing books).  A statement saying that their political agenda is a matter of contention might also be included to indicate not everyone things that they are all sunshine and roses.  I think the next section should be \"\"History and Organization\"\" and outline when and by whom they were founded, it's organization structure, the fact that the board is mostly American, it's funding, and it's membership in other organization.  I think that the bit about what their activities (both in the historical section and in the organization section with the quote) should be moved to the next section, \"\"Activities.\"\"  The Activities (though that is maybe a bad heading) would include the above statements of what Freedom House's claims of prior activities are, the fact that they publish book and details of those books, and the information contained in the \"\"other activities\"\" section.  The final section, I think should be titled something along the lines of \"\"Political Leanings, Agenda, and Controversy\"\" or something, and would be a space for the differing views of Freedom House to be discussed.  The validity (or lack their of) of their ratings, if they are bias in favor of an Ameri-centric point of view, and if they are neo-cons or not could be discussed here.  If the proceding sections are well written, they will be limited to things that can be easily verified, and all the debate about if Freedom House is good or bad will be contained in this section.     Calling this section \"\"Criticisms\"\" has implications that I don't think are necessarly correct.\n",

Up to that point, djembe and dunun were confined to the traditional Malinke area (Mali, Guinea, and parts of Burkina Faso, Senegal, and Ivory Coast).)

      "Scylla is supposed to be a beautiful nymph. A man called Glaucus fell in love with her. She didn’t like him and so ran away from him, effectively rejecting her. Therefore Glaucus went to a sorceress, Circe and asked for Scylla’s heart to be softened. Circe however fell in love with Glaucus who rejected her. Circe was angry at Scylla, not Glaucus and so, when Scylla was about to bathe, she poured a powerful poison into Scylla’s pool and so when Scylla bathed she turned into a horrible monster with twelve feet and six heads, all with 3 rows of teeth. Wolf heads grew from her waist and she just stood there, each one of her heads taking someone who passed her. She hated everything which came within reach and killed it.\n",
      "What makes it a Good Story?\n",
      "The story of the transformation of Scylla is a good story as it seems to make people realise their emotions when they hear about how Scylla was turned into an eternal being of pure evil even though she did nothing to anyone. She didn’t accept Glaucus’s love and so was turned into a supernatural being because of someone else’s jealousy of her looks.\n",

Then Ben Stiller arrived 10 minutes after the commentary started and then started arguing with the director Rawson Marshall Thurber and even burping sometimes. After about 25 minutes Thurber becomes very annoyed with the stupidity of Ben Stiller and leaves the studio. Then both Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn did anything besides commenting the film, with Vaughn even threatening the crew at the studio. After about 40 minutes from the beginning of the commentary a woman comes in the studio and tells Ben that if he doesn't move his car it will be towed. After this both Stiller and Vaughn leave the studio with almost an hour left in the film! The two men of the studio crew then, in total embarassment, put on the commentary of There's Something about Mary. This proves the complete unprofessionality of Vaughn and Stiller. They behaved awfully, Stiller, after 5 minutes of his arrival wanted to leave and Vaughn insulted one of the studio crew members and, after Thurber went away they began criticizing him.

English cuisine, Cantonese cuisine, Vietnamese cuisine, etc.). I agree that there should be a separate article for the cuisine of ethnic Hawaiians, but the other article should not be about colonial Hawaiian cuisine; it should be called Cuisine of Hawaii and be about the cuisine of the island of Hawaii, documenting all the cuisines found there, including ethnic Hawaiian cuisine. It will not be a parent article for the ethnic Hawaiian cuisine article because that article will include the introduction of Hawaiian cuisine into other regions of the world. 2) The name of the article about the cuisine of ethnic Hawaiians should remain at Hawaiian cuisine, not be moved to Native Hawaiian cuisine.

I've been on wikibreak for a while so I haven't been able to follow what happened with the big \"\"plagiarism on the main page\"\" discussion. I thought you might be interested as I recall you were one of the main drivers of that discussion. If it's still ongoing, I'd be happy to join in.

I actually did not intend to become a \"\"main driver\"\" of the plagiarism discussion, nor did I intend to become \"\"Plagiarism Central\"\", but alas and alack, so it has turned out )  What fueled that whole thing was me trying to discover how the \"\"reward culture\"\" on Wiki was fueling plagiarism and copyvio at DYK to feed ill-prepared RFA candidates, and I never expected the problem to turn out to be as big as it has.  Anyway, I think we can summarize what has happened with that discussion as 1) slightly more awareness of plagiarism and copyvio on Wiki; 2) much more work for our few qualified copyvio people; 3) little change that I've been able to detect at DYK or ITN (but I don't follow closely enough); 4) circling of the wagons curiously in defense of copyvio by some ArbCom members and some extremely distasteful commentary coming from some arbs; and 5) curiously, even some resistance at FAC to tightening procedures to detect copyvio, with a second copyvio getting through FAC only a week after the Halloween mainpage debacle.   On the copyvio you detected above, I'm not certain you handled it correctly by stubbifying the article, rather than adding the  tag and alerting the copyvio people, you don't allow them to 1) look for other copyvios by the same author, 2) educate that author, and 3) remove the copyvio from article history.  You might want to go through those steps as well.   As to the lack of mainpage scrutiny, I 'spose it will take time, a few more debacles, and a few less unprofessional arbs before the issue is taken seriously.   (Talk) \"\n",

For these segments, he is also provided a rifle (does someone give him a rifle at the beginning of each segment?), the functionality of which changes with the kind of ammunition being used (how so?, also maybe \"\"changes depending on the ammunition used\"\"). The car driving (\"\"driving\"\", \"\"car\"\" is implied) segments (segmentsX2) usually involve Jak racing against time (prose, try \"\"have specific time constraints\"\") to complete a mission (that is what one does with missions), while defending himself against other cars (cars attack people?) or giant Metal Heads (?). When not on a mission (missionX3), Jak wanders the streets of either Spargus or Haven City (prose, and what reason do we have to care which fictional city he is wandering in?), searching for someone to assign him a mission (this sentence makes him sound so lame).\n",

What we currently have on project is a kind of pre-tribal band system, which can look like any other system (because the elements of all sophisticated political systems are present 'in the bud' in social bands). There are some elements of tribal society developing (Arbcom and administrators fill a role 'tribal elders' in loose tribal aggregates, policy and guidelines take on an almost mystical/devotional role in some discussions), but on individual pages it still largely devolves to conflicts between small ideologically insular groups fighting for control of a resource.

These features are noticeably absent from many of the more contentious discussions on project.  If we are not willing to take the steps to achieve a properly functioning consensus system, then we would really do better to try for another less-open approach, because dysfunctional consensus systems are ugly, ugly, ugly beasts.

      "I am sure that clarity would help; if only we could agree as to what one would say. The knub of the disagreement comes in the relationship between Acts and the letters. Long arguments have already taken place between those who, supported by scholars such as Conzelman, think Acts to have a comparatively low historical value, emphasising the hostility towards Judaism expressed in Galatians, and those who regard Scripture as consistent de fide so that any one statement must be reconcilable with any other. Critical scholarship makes the second view difficult to hold, though it is represented in the article. the statement about St. Paul's prctice would be controverted on precisely these grounds by a number of editors and, more important, by scholars. It is always hard for editors to cope with the fact that we are not, as a matter of WP policy in a position to say that anything is 'indefensible. That is POV - a point of view. We can say that this learned person or that has argued in this way or that.

Although I think the underlying point is that the quote section has heretofore been used as kind of a dumping ground for Ann's more outrageous quotes in what appears to be an attempt to confirm her detractors portrait of her as an out of control nut-case. So, if I had to come down on this tiny controversy, I'd say either remove all the quotes to WikiQuote or simply add some quotes that seem more trenchant and insightful to counter the obvious attempt at caricature. There are some more important lingering POV issues with this article (although I still maintain it's vastly improved over what I stumbled upon less than a month ago.

I'd be willing to buy something in between 200 to 400 million for Crosby (likely towards the lower end), but the problem is that not many sources mention this. I don't know if it's because Bing Crosby has been largely forgotten now - Yeah dream on, Crosby's sales were well over 400 million by 1980, 27 years ago, and it's funny that this \"\"largely forgotten\"\" entertainer has the biggest selling jazz album at amazon.

      "Well I might consider and then might even agree with you that perhaps one could point me to WP:DBAD (here spelled in a form of euphemism for my potential benefit -) ), as I consider you had pointed me (  ;-)  ), but that still hasn't given any solutions to the disagreement which goes on the talk page (here I mean the Talk:International recognition of Kosovo page). As far as the WP:RM (if this is what you had in mind) is concerned, my opinion is that the third conversator  thinks other of the procedure (I'm still not sure that there is one). Moreover, I'm certain that for the time being he doesn't think of another POV of the \"\"procedure\"\", because of this words of his, which are somehow unclear (at least to me): \"\"Any new proposals will be speedy closed. Persistence will be dealt with sanctions as per the WP:ARBMAC probation this article is under the scope of.\"\" concerning the closure of \"\"proposal\"\". I'm not sure if he meant new proposals through the talk page of International recognition of Kosovo (\"\"IroK\"\") or through the WP:RM. Actually, I find WP:RM somehow vague on the sequence of steps to be taken when new request/proposal is to be made. I've tried to follow the procedure proposed as it is given at WP:RM, but then I might misunderstood something. I might consider asking for explanation on the very own project's page, as for that matter. Hus, as a formalist as I consider you at the moment, I must ask you now this: when you wrote all controversial move proposals must go through... in order to have any validity you actully wanted to write all controversial move proposals should go through...in order to have any validity. I suppose I pointed out ( one might consider I've used irony, I apologize to those) to the ambiguity of interpretation of the potential procedure, since the very procedure hasn't been tagged as a guideline, but still named a project, to the least. Maybe, some other place exists, which I'm not aware of - I apologize in advance for me being somewhat a whiner, since I've been passive and not searching for potential one myself. Not to mention judgemental and still non-constructive enough, to contribute myself (although recognition of the problem might be considered as form of contiributing action -? -/ ).

      "Ijanderson977, you asked: Why are you not claiming that this article has a POV title: International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia? Well, actually, I do consider this title is biased also. But personally I consider the \"\"IroK\"\" more globally important, not just to me, as one might think it is. If the bias is dealt with this issue (IroK title), it could be dealt elsewhere also. And IMHO it is good to keep the discussion in one place -> maybe creating a new page, where this discussion concerning the term \"\"recognition\"\" (or more) could be taken, should be considered as an idea.\n",

      "Yeah, they really exist. You need at least one w-3 (one FA from that class) and one w-6 (one from that class) and you can make the others from them (a few carnivores species need more). Essential fatty acid deficiency was first seen in people getting total intravenous nutrition, where, for obvious reasons they put in only amino acids, sugar, vitamins and minerals (fat emulsions were quite hard to develop as IV formulas). The reason for the problem is that the body can make facts but cannot introduce unsaturation closer to the end than w-9, and you NEED w-6 and w-3 fatty acids to make lipids (the w-3 DHA is your most common neural tissue fat).  I'll see what I can do to put in some general refs from academic nutrition books. There is some quackery out there (like pills that contain w-9 because olive oil is cheap) but most of the fish oil supplements are worth taking, actually, unless you eat cold water ocean fish regularly.  BTW, there is some evidence that that bad reputation of saturated fats are from experiments in which animals were fed only hydrogenated coconut oil for their fat source. This destroys all essential fatty acids because it destroys all PUFAs. On such a diet, even DOGS get severe atherosclerosis, and they are species highly resistant to it (their HDLs are higher than their LDLs). So all this is quite fascinating.  \"\n",

Due to prior research of the fighters involved in the first three bouts and common knowledge of the sport, all common sense and logic led to me believing (like I always did) that the order of the bouts on the mobile version was the correct one.

      "I think the intitial problem here is a WIkiepdia-old ownership issue - the very language Parrot of Doom uses gives this away. Although I agreed with his revert in this case (there are better ways present the fact of Griffin's well known bigotry than just to define him a 'bigot'), when I read his \"\"biased garbage\"\" edit note I was appalled at both the rudeness and politics, and planned to warn him myself tonight. As with myself, Nfitz is an experienced editor (from 2005 in his case, 2006 in mine). Also, I am VERY worried about Parrot's real stance on far right issues, despite what he says about Griffin on his user page. It’s an unfortunate truth that many people who so foolishly support the BNP just want certain policies and issues to made more public, and are not at all Griffin fans. I hope people can digest that comment. The BNP are also very, very clever, and without question far right – so I think we are all entitled to be wary of them from a Human Rights stance, whatever some people might insist about dotting each ‘i’ of the WP:AGF policy. Parrot has reacted to edits in this manner before, and if he (or anyone else) does it again I won't hesitate to make an official complaint, both on the rudeness and bias in the content.\n",

Especially given the dangerous politics involved from one side only here, and considering what should be expected to happen from the middle ground with this article being so plainly lily-livered - about a terrifying political disease that so nearly destroyed Europe. They won't be so keen to line up, and will answer to people like me if they are too hasty. And Jews perhaps, Muslims, blacks - people like that? I'm still reeling from the 'mainstream' introduction I saw here last Thursday. I insist the BNP could not have come up with a better article themselves, as any showing less of their true values would hardly pass. The article had 100,000 hits (obviously - how can we be surprised about that?) and single-handedly proved right the nationally-made argument on why Griffin should not have been invited to the TV show: the irresponsible media (mainly Wikipedia, alas) will be able to casually present Griffin as a standard mainstream politician. And all in the name of supposed damage-limitation to Wikipedia's own credibility. \n",

Any argument that says prospective far right voters (if I'm actually allowed to use that term 'far right'?) can cleverly ‘read between lines’ - or even bother to read to the end of articles - is simply fully naive. Besides, the introduction is king with the reader, as it summerises what is below it. The majority of BNP supporters are THE most vulnerable people in Britain – and often the least educated. Wikipedia consistently ignores both the reader and the subject in its self-providing calculations, and with this deliberately damage-limited article (to put it most politely), it has manifestly helped to ‘rubber stamp’ fascism in the UK. A lot of people (esp non-Europeans) won’t know what that means, but many of us would agree that Wikipedia can scarcely have had a lower day.   \"\n",

      "hallo Moondyne, I do admit that when I signed onto Wikipedia I was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge Nazis but now that I am aware of it I will make the appropriate adjustments. I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts, knowledge and information. The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about, discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here. There exists, in various libraries, books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain. The fact that a story is not accepted by \"\"mainstream\"\" academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group (i.e. Hesperian and his friends) who are representatives of the \"\"mainstream\"\" view. Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian's mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian's antagonistic attitude, simple, old fashioned professional jealousy. Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons. For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden, identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia. This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates, which is a pity, but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different. Still it is dissapointing. Happy trails.    \"\n",

I conducted harassment and interdiction fire. I used 50 calibre machine guns, which we were granted and ordered to use, which were our only weapon against people. I took part in search and destroy missions, in the burning of villages.  All of this is contrary to the laws of warfare, all of this is contrary to the Geneva Conventions and all of this is ordered as a matter of written established policy by the government of the United States from the top down. And I believe that the men who designed these, the men who designed the free fire zone, the men who ordered us, the men who signed off the air raid strike areas, I think these men, by the letter of the law, the same letter of the law that tried Lieutenant Calley, are war criminals.   \n",

All other things being equal we should use newer versions (though many contain commentaries so can be construed as secondary). But Bede seems to have been messed with over the years. Particularly, you'll find there appears to be a lacuna in all versions - Bede promises to return to \"\"the siege of Badon-hill, when they made no small slaughter of those enemies, about forty-four years after their arrival in England. But of this hereafter.\"\" And \"\"hereafter\"\" never comes: what comes is the only loss of temporal sequence in the book. So this is why comprehensive secondary sources are needed. Anyhow, I am not going to try to impose some novel reading but on the other hand I accept that Martin of Tours was a soldier, Germanus led an army, Patrick's mission was accompanied by a Saxon fleet (Annals of Ulster) - I do not want to suppress this information in the service of an unrealistically sweetened picture of these Christian saints either. So this is why I am wary of the idea that those British bishops were dedicated to \"\"Romanism\"\" - in fact the British invented all this \"\"Joseph of Arimathea\"\" stuff purely in order to claim an apostolic succession that did NOT involve Rome. In this context I find it significant that David was made Archbishop in Jerusalem - and that this western Archbishopric has completely disappeared!   \"\n",

There were 147 detailed citations, which sourced the work of such noted Kid historians as Philip J. Rasch, Robert M. Utley and Frederick Nolan among many others.

That means you have to go to the third or fourth page, or go to the \"\"D\"\" listings, to see the historic district subcategory.  That sort of makes sense, but it still doesn't get it listed on the first page.\n",
      " The reason I created the subcategory for houses is because there are over 3400 entries in Category:National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts, which is absolutely huge.  I'm using Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser to recategorize the houses into their own subcategory, so that'll organize them somewhat better.  Eventually, I'm hoping to set up the infobox generator to check the historic function of the property, so if the function is listed as \"\"Single Dwelling\"\" (code \"\"01A\"\"), it'll automatically put the property into the houses category.\n",
      " Speaking of the infobox generator, I finally had time to implement two of the changes you suggested.  I fixed the bug where seconds of latitude were being listed as 60, and I added the \"\" | coord_parameters = region:US_type:landmark\"\" parameter.  I haven't done the last-name-first suggestion yet.  I was hoping to find a way to automatically try to reverse the name to try looking for the last name first, but I haven't fully figured this out yet.   (Elkspeak) \"\n",

For instance, if a guy plays for Colorado in the 2006 season and is traded to Columbus before the 2007 season begins, only 2006 is listed.  But if a guy plays for Colorado in the 2006 season and is traded to Columbus during the 2007 season (June, say), both 2006 and 2007 are listed as years for his Colorado tenure even if he didn't play a match for Colorado during 2007.

Her mother is a professional and has worked for the government for almost 30 years and her father is retired.   Traci was raised on staage at the age of 2 starting with ballet then tap, then jazz.... she was a natural on stage..... throughout her childhood she was in pagaents and sport like softball, volleyball and track in high school, she competed in many events: Miss Wright State of OHIO,All American Drill Team.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Traci graduated, her love of dance and people took her to a business college, where she studied basics in business management.  Then she learned ins and outs of banking and later took on another degree in Medical Techology. She also did promotional work for , bartended , ran local bars and competed in bikini contests for extra funds.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1996, Traci started lifting weights with a friend and saw a photo of Marla Duncan winning a national competition. Her beauty and physique impressed her enough that she wanted to try what she was doing - Fitness Competitions. At the time she was developing some problems medically and noticed herself gaining some weight.   Traci thought weight training would help but she found that because she is a natural she responded almost imediately to the weights which caused her to get pretty stocky and very strong quick.  She was still eating normally but when it comes to bikini contests you need to be lean and feminine.... well this is when the Army Soldiers took a noticed to her.  She was at Ft. Hood, TX and was left alone because a lot of times soldiers are away for months to years and she was pretty shy meeting others because she had always been very much independent.  So she decided to check out while in studies some competitions related to the Army.  This is where she found out about obstacles course contests... so she knew she was strong and stocky so maybe this would be better for her.  So she entered her first WTF competition with little or know training and out of 100 girls made nationals in top 10. but something happened ... she started noticing her weight wasn't changing and she was developing back problems and fatigue.   She had always had problems with being healthy as a kid and seemed to get sick a lot.  Her Father was always on her about bundling up.  One day her discomfort and taken so much that she ended up in the emergency room... this is when she found that her bowels had backed up into her system and she was lucky because if was really serious... the only time she had ever dealt with hospitals is with her hearing... she had lost her hearing at four along with being sick all the time... and at 17 had to have implants put in which was a miracle cause it gave her 80% back... but she is still considered hearing impaired... now this is happening to her... she had gained a weight up to 180 and looked very stocky... the doctors didn't know what was wrong with her.... she spent three days being detoxed so to speak... when they didn't know if she had lupus, rheumatoid, but later found traces of cancer in her colon... but she didn't let it get her down. So she reenrolled in school again for more college degrees towards nutrition in NC.   Up until 2002 she only competed for fun, not as a money making career. In 2002 she was honored with several titles in many organizations like Hawaiian Tropic, Venus, Ms Fitness and Sport Aerobics and WTF.. it wasn't til she had heard she was on ESPN2 every month for one year and honored on the front page of her local newspaper and found herself in several articles in OXYGEN. This helped Traci realize that she had potential to earn some actual money in the fitness industry. She kept competing and in April of '2002 moved to an organization which she had heard was tough and very different from others called NPC /IFBB.  This is where Arnold S. Slyvester Stalone and many more came out of you know the BOYS CLUB Once she arrived, competing in her first NPC she had found a very different way they handled threi shows and treated the competitors... Shoop coming from a strong female in charge background family life saw that this was going to be a challenge for her... she had dreamed of maybe getting more exposure and getting the chance to really be friends with some of the hollywood celebrities.  During the time she was studying nutriiton she always had more than several ideas and projects in mind to bring to the future.... now she has alwsy felt competing natural was always her best route and found with no help and little support she was able to conquer her enemies and achieve her goals.  She was always wnadering why thes other girls who seemed to get covers and major sponsors did it... where she found herself funding everything on her little $7 an hour because she as a military spouse never made as much in those cities because the husband was the provider she was tired of the little she wanted bigger she knew that s\n",

He initially was a Computer Engineering major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, NY, but when he moved to Boston attended Emerson College, where he studied videography and graphic design.  At that time, he also worked as a typeface designer and for the world.std.com internet service provider, whose praises he sings on his website (in a rare moment where he is not being outrageously tongue-in-cheek).  He has a great artistic eye for typeface and developed several fonts in use today.\n",

This information isn't trivial content.  Details about lots of notable individuals' nonnotable spouses permeates Wikipeda unrelentingly.  Properly sourced information about significant events in people's lives, such as marriage, divorce, births/deaths of loved ones, is not the same as saying, \"\"Bob Ross like cheese,\"\" even if one were to find a source for that statement.  Your deletion of this isnormation does, in fact, fly in the face of well-established community-driven consensus.  Examine any biographical article, and you will find lots of information, [presumably] properly sourced, that you, as an apparent deletionist, might find strictly banal and useless.\n",

      "It should be noted that the details about his wives was very short, noting only their names (obviously their last names were Ross, and unless their maiden names were in a source, one could not publish it) and the durations of their marriages.  Such a short, sourced statement is surely not worth pursuing like this.  Yuor edits were reverted because you did not provide a valid reason for soing so.  As per the widely-held and practiced policy of including any properly sourced information in biographical articles mentioned above, you need to discuss first changes which go against the consensus.  There's always the possibility that you might provide convincing arguments, and even influence consensus-driven policies  but definitely not in this case.  The users who addressed your actions are well-seasoned, and are familiar with the consensus to the point of being able to enforce it on matters presicely like this without needing to query the community.  For you to be able to make the changes you made  as I said  you must discuss it first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Making changes that violate policy can easily be construed as vandalism  it suggests that you either didn't read or care to abide by the community standards  but that is incorrect.  The policy of vandalism states, in part:Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism. Even harmful edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered vandalism. For example, adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism — it's just not helpful, and should be removed or restated.It appears to me that you indended to be helpful, as a deletionist, but it flew in the face of established community consensus and policy.  I will remind those editors who made those comments to you about vandalism the specific of policy, but the bottom line is: do not remove properly sourced information from Wikipedia without prior discussion.  This is really not a matter of needing to arbitrate, because this is a matter of content dispute, which whould be discussed on appropriate talk pages. -  talk \"\n",

      "-  Pris also runs towards him from outside the conapt as opposed to inside it - i.e. she has been following Deckard as Racheal and not holed up with the rest of the Andys\n",
      "- Racheal is really distraught in the hotel room when she finds out about Pris being the last android, it would make much more sense for her fear to be because it is her rather than the same android model.  It is only when she offers to kill it herself that she calms down.  But then she would - she had just claimed to kill herself (i.e. bluff Pris' death or possibly commit suicide).\n",

      "Admittedly there's a couple of snags.  If she is Racheal then she is working for the Rosen corporation, so why is she hiding with the runaways?  Unless she \"\"ran away\"\" from the corporation after Deckard originally tested her.  \n",

      "\". Some just make things up as if it substitutes for the truth, and use \"\"mistakes\"\" as \"\"proof\"\" of being \"\"disruptive.\"\" But, very few actually can cite facts, inaccurate edits, nor bother to even think about checking sources cited. It is much easier to \"\"complain about Theodore7\"\" and to \"\"revert\"\" since following Wikipedia's principles about biting newcomers is an \"\"excuse\"\" since it \"\"does not exist\"\" and \"\"does not happen\"\" to any newcomer. And, if they mention it - they are \"\"using\"\" it since it doesn't exist, etc., etc. This is just one of the many problems Wikipedia newcomers face with such people. It is so much easier not to care about any subject, nor to check sources (as I do as a journalist) and to find inaccurate and unfactual materials while avoiding POV. But, to play games, to have personality conflicts as if they actually know the people they are writing to. They avoid resolving matters peacefully, but highly enjoy creating fights, building molehills into mountains, and love throwing out wild accusations. They don't ask - they assume - they immediately accuse, then complain loudly. They take everthing personally - all the while - not reading, checking sources, nor citing sources themselves on the subjects in question but adding plenty of their own POV that is not neutral, nor cited with sources. If sources run counter to their POV - then they use ruses to attempt to divert attention: and ask for RFCs on Wikipedia members who just got here, and request arbitration to resolve situations they have not even started to resolve on their own - yet claiming that they have tried. Perhaps, if some spend much more time actually checking sources, citing them, and making sure that the encylopedic materials are factual then, the \"\"revert wars\"\" by some who want to re-write history to fit their own personal views would end, and Wikipedia could be that much more successful. So, if one is to gather evidence - show just where my edits are vandalism - where? I'd like to see it. Show my edit summaries. Show my edits, and don't cite my early mistakes as \"\"proof\"\" of being \"\"disruptive\"\" since I'd like to see someone claim they do not make mistakes themselves. Oh, one more thing. When a person defends themselves - try not to dismiss it as a \"\"diatribe\"\" - but actually read it in context and take responsbility for one's own \"\"claims\"\" against the person - in this case, a new member of Wikipedia. I've had enough of my comments being taken out of context, then pasted onto RFC and arbitration sections - and used as \"\"proof\"\" of me being a bad person, and disruptive. I say different, and have the right to defend myself against what I consider to be a classic case of biting Wikipedia newcomers. I will take credit for my honest mistakes, but not for accusations that are false. My evidence are the comments, and retorts, and my edits - which, are cited, and soucred. Any arbitrator who wants to know more about my edits and comments can feel free to ask, or to view my comments IN CONTEXT and not TAKEN OOUT OF CONTEXT by some who are doing the constant \"\"complaining.\"\" I see no proof of any infactual edits on my part. And, my early mistakes are just that - mistakes that most newcomers to Wikipedia make. That does not justify, say your own comments Bunchofgrapes, and those of the other \"\"revert warriors\"\" - who, in my opinion, are ruining Wikipedia. So, I've made inquiries elsewhere to make sure that perhaps this comes to an end, and that my case can be used as an example of what happens - negatively - to newcomers who run up against those who signed the RFC, and asked for arbitration. My evidence is there - my work to this time, my edits, sourcing, and using the Talk Pages - which I do not abuse, but use to add comments relevant to the subject at hand\"\n",

In particular, without having carefully reviewed it myself, I strongly suspect that we have a large number of mostly redundant references.  A source we use in one section might be perfectly adequate to support a fact we state in a different section.  As often as that is the case, we can remove one of the references, and just refer to it in both places.  This takes some real editorial work, but I would not be at all surprised if such work could eliminate 1/3 or even 1/2 of the references as redundant, while still keeping the article well compliant with WP:RS and WP:CITE.

      "Bill, sorry for not responding sooner to your question about the military versions of the 90, and the general length of the article. I've been mulling it over, and I'm still not sure what would be best, but I'm wondering about splitting the article into one about the 90/100 series and another about the 200/300 series. That, to me, is where the logical split is, in a number of ways. The 200/300 (including 350), went by \"\"Super King Air\"\", and while there's a lot of commonality between the 90 and 100, there's much less so between the 100 and 200 (the exception would be the 90F which borrowed the 200's tail, but I wouldn't worry about that).

      "\n",
      "Hello. May I ask why you removed the fact that the Somaliland region is internationally recognized as an autonomous region of Somalia from the Ethiopian airlines article? You do realize that the airline itself, like the international community as a whole, does not recognize any such country called \"\"Somaliland\"\" and only includes Somalia in its literature (e.g. here), right? In fact, it doesn't even mention Somaliland on its website [2]. So what gives? Is there a second Ethiopian Airlines website I should know about? Also, in your second revert [3], you completely removed the Frequent Flyer Program section that I had just added. What's the point of that too? Why not just revert the Somaliland section if that is all you object to? Why a wholesale revert? Regards, Middayexpress (talk) \n",
      "\n",
      "Hi. Thanks for your contributions to Wikipedia. There is an article in Wikipedia for Somaliland where the readers can get all the information they need, including the ones you mention. Wikipedia is simply an encyclopedia, where neutral points of view should be stated. That said, it doesn't matter whether the airline or even Ethiopia recognises Somaliland or not, the only thing that matters is that it flew once to a destination within its territory. Moreover, it doesn't matter to which state (recognised or not even by the UN) Hargeisa is the capital of as to an article concerning any airline, not only Ethiopian. As already stated in the Airline Project guidelines, airline articles as well as pages related to their destinations should only reflect information with neutral points of view. Regarding ShebaMiles, the frequent flyer programme and its description is properly depicted within the codeshare agreements sub-section of the Destinations section, where it is also stated that the company has a codesahre agreement with Lufthansa, as with many other airlines. Scattering information related to the same stuff all through the article renders it disordered. Best wishes.Jetstreamer (talk) \n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for your response. Articles should indeed reflect a neutral point of view. However, removing clarification of the fact that the city of Hargeisa is internationally recognized as a part of Somalia is not neutral. It's actually the opposite of neutral since all of the other images on the Ethiopian Airlines article that show actual Ethiopian Airlines aircraft in various airports around the world all list country-level destinations (viz. United Arab Emirates, England, Ethiopia). They do not list regional-level destinations; only the Hargeisa picture does and that's the point. Unless one wants to deliberately give the impression that Somaliland is recognized as country of its own on par with the aforementioned actual nations, a clarifying note will have to be added indicating that the Somaliland region is actually internationally regarded as a region of Somalia. This is even more necessary considering the fact that Ethiopian Airlines itself doesn't even appear to acknowledge any such sub-national let alone national entity; it only recognizes Somalia in its literature, as shown above (please leave a response if any here so that the discussion is all in one place). Regards, Middayexpress (talk) \n",
      "\n",
      "Do you think the last change I made to Ethiopian Airlines destinations solves the issue? Please let me know what you think.

      "\n",
      "That won't do because Somaliland is still listed in the country column alongside actual countries, including the Somalia which it is internationally regarded as an autonomous region of. It is also the only such disputed territory listed on the table and in such a way. That makes the presentation still far from neutral.

Thus, as I said on Talk, I'm going to stick with helping Ling.Nut get his rewrite ready. I hope admins will continue to monitor the Six Day War article and protect it so that versions which have had gone through extensive discussion and consensus-forming processes are not simply reverted by these guys who refuse to discuss their objections/suggestions, etc. If you can do anything to help out the majority of editors who are reasonably working together to improve the article in this regard, I would appreciate it. And it's probably fair for me to speak for that majority in that regard. I trust my decision to let other editors whom I discuss the wording with actually implement the agreed version(s) will demonstrate my good faith to admins responsible for twice blocking me.

      "To Huon and Stephan2 ' At the present time I do not agree with either of your positions regarding the use of images on the Sergio Franchi biography. First of all are enough images.\"\" I do not believe that editors should be concerned with the absolute number of images. I do not believe that pictures which represent different aspects of a person's life are excessive. On the Filmography I used lots of images because Franchi was in a lot of TV productions. On the biography page, I am sure I could remove a few images, but our culture is image-driven and I used the images believing that their use would draw attention to this person's life. Dying before the advent of the internet his memory was almost allowed to die because none of his contemporaries carried his story onto the internet..thus my desire to preserve the biography of a person who was very important during the late 20th century in musical and theater history. As for my own motives as an editor of Wikipedia, I have used my work on these pages to increase my expertise as a Wikipedia editor, and have made contributions on every page that I felt competent to add at the time. This has also increased my editorial knowledge.  Enough about personal motivation. As to the issue at hand... Wikipedia's biography portal describes a biography as \"\"a detailed description of someone's life. More than a list of basic facts [education, relationships, and death)....a biography ...highlights various aspects of his or her life....\"\" THAT is why I believe that the non-free image depicting Franchi's beloved avocations were deserving of representation in the 2 photos showing his automobile and pewter collections. I also felt that a textual statement would be enhanced by the 2 photos that I had discovered. As to the Non-free book cover depicting Sergio Franchi's 18 months of his life on the Broadway stage musical \"\"Nine'..as you are aware, usually only the original creator of the role is given fair space. However, his role was considered import enough by the producers to warrant new posters, programs, and an original song...I believe that the visual reminder of his impact on musical theater in 1984 was important. There were no other free images available after 1976 when the copyright law regarding publicity photos. I am interested in improving as an editor, and if you still believe that I should remove the Library of Congress image (Pewter collection), I will comply with your suggestion. Please consider my argument on it's retention. Thanks  \n",

      "David Starr has re-posted the POV alert tag on this page. I do not feel he ever fully addressed my questions. He is asserting that the page shows overwhelming bias in some way - according to him there are only two specific single line instances that he cites of bias on the page, both in the bio. This does not a biased page make.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have clearly refuted both of these claims at length, with no response (despite repeated requests) from Starr. \n",
      "\n",
      "1) The \"\"garbage\"\" passage is balanced with an explanation from a Da spokesperson. The source is quoted, phrase is neutral, and source (scholar Georg Feuerstein) is not in dispute by Starr. The mention is crucial because it explains the \"\"controversial\"\" aspect in first line of lead, and period is alluded to in Adidam apologies for \"\"controversial\"\" earlier behavior and in the numbers of lawsuits, news articles, and analysis by authorities linked to and discussed in Da page. Also, further explained by Da himself in \"\"Crazy Wisdom\"\" section in teaching.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Mention of 1986 breakdown/Divine Emergence. This is a significant event, as attested by Adi Da press. Source is not biased, all mentions of events are phrased neutrally within basic journalistic standards. Balanced with Adi Da self-assessment as personally significant event (about which an entire book was written.)\n",
      "\n",
      "3)\"\"Undue weight\"\" was shown to be unreasonable, as each line is short without subjective exposition. On balance throughout page, all potentially \"\"controversial\"\" material (in every case sourced, cited, and neutrally phrased) is far outweighed by neutral info and Da \"\"self-assessment.\"\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Every potentially controversial mention is carefully contextualized and phrased to reflect source, and balanced with an alternate explanation. In every case. \n",
      "\n",
      "Source disputes:\n",
      "1) Gurdjieff Journal: no specific instances of bias are alleged by Starr from this source. Starr is simply questioning the source without saying why it is an issue. Did not address my point that source is only used because it summarizes bio info from Da, Rudi, and Siddha Yoga accounts. No bias is reflected in WP entry, no has any been revealed. And Starr has failed to show how magazine is biased or \"\"self-published\"\" simply making assertion that it is a \"\"competing religious organization\"\" which is simply unproven (there is no Gurdjieff church or \"\"organization\"\").\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Lake County News: source has been used for other articles, Starr only questions it for single mention that he subjectively finds to his dislike (the Divine Emergence passage). He has not worked to find alternative source that would allow the material about a significant event to remain. Source has been found acceptable to all other editors in past months, as demonstrated by its repeated use. Starr cannot singly enter now and discount source, when not showing WP guideline that effectively discounts it (only his own subjective analysis of the quality of the \"\"contact\"\" page on their website.)\n",
      "\n",
      "All other editors, including myself, have been involved in give an take on this page, making allowances and corrections for each other - even yesterday I made changes to accommodate other editors, including Starr. I do not feel that Starr is meeting this standard, and in particular completely failed to address my repeated specific requests. Because of this, I am removing the POV tag as vandalism and an attempt to discount page. I have requested third party review, and perhaps further dispute resolution.   \"\n",

I could also bring sources like uwarzamrze.pl, wpolityce.pl, wprost.pl, onet.pl and many others. But niezalezna.pl seems to provide the most of information on that investigation, the most detailed. You can always say they are political, right-wing, etc., and you can always call every investigation of any crime a “political game” because there is almost always someone who could benefit on it… But there is an interesting thing: If the Law and Justice party and all the “right-wing extremists” are pushing a fake-theory of an assassination, then why they are all demanding an international investigation on it and all the others are so afraid of it? What do they have to hide? Why the Law and Justice party runs the risk of an international shame and loss of all the voters support if it was really an accident? \n",

Just because the terrorists ruling in Russia (responsible for many other political murders – will you deny that?) said so, because they led an investigation on it and the Polish government confirmed it and all the mainstream media repeated it and then all the international media repeated after them (what else should they do?). And the only other investigation with a rational conclusion with a hypothesis of explosions is a “fringe theory” that has to be removed...  Also one thing I have to add here: do you know anything about the war between Georgia and Russia in 2008 and the role of L. Kaczynski there? Do you know that he gathered four other countries leaders (Lithuania, Estonia, Ukraine, Latvia), went to Tbilisi and forced Russian army to stop the attack on Georgia? See:  Do you know there was already an assassination attempt on him right there, in Georgia? See: . Do you know that the Katyn_massacre was also a revenge? \n",
      "However, after all, I’m glad that you finally focused on merits and try to find some other explanation for the explosions, that about the fuel tanks. (then the official reports must be lies, too.) As I know, the fuel has to be mixed with air/oxygen in some proportion to explode, otherwise, with a surface-contact with air, it fires slowly. However, It is all to be investigate by an international commission. And, about the balance in the article, the only reliable theory is about 5% of contents and you say it’s too much...\n",

You see, Aleta ,  I am a human not god. it's question of creditability  not only mine but also of an entity – identity  in question. I provided all the facts what so ever was demanded by wikipedian editors or opposers. But without investigating /verifying my news/reviews on Sonee , the administrator ruthlessly  deleted it under influence of  4-5 people. Have they kept  two lines over there on the person in question. I would had not raised my voice. Frustration & fighting for my democratic rights are two different issue. You can put me in any slot. It’s your view and mind. However ,  This might be an inspiration from  Sonee to me or person like Gandhi where person has to fight his  battle alone. Without dying no body can enjoy heaven. I have learnt form such people –if  you  are certain to certify self  reasoning or common sense considering it  ethically right then  least care what might the world think of you. One should act and speak right. & that’s what I am doing here. Few people have label my writing as soap box, unreliable etc… God bless them. They don’t know  about the person what revolution his voice is going to influence the world in future. Jesus, Kabir  did not changed the world in a day. No wikipedia was there then to suppress such voices or sharing their info. Strangely Good or  ridiculously bad human one day are in scripted in history. May be Jesus or Bin Laden. So my suggestion to you as a well wisher is never leave your good deed, Person like Graeme & You are rare angel breed. I can feel from my inner sense of little wisdom . I may or may not raise the page on Sonee as my mood is very upset @ present, but ever if couple of you angels feel to raise Sonee page once again any of  your good selves can go contribute for the betterment of world welfare deeds.  Try it. You will get a peaceful sleep. Because real angels never sleep unless they help a true person in difficulty successfully. They don’t leave the victim in middle of ocean.  I am fed up putting my points clicking reading all wiki pages. I  have gone mad to convince them. It’s just writing on sand.  So,  If your instinct feel Sonee deserve two line after reading below talk page of Graeme & Keeper76  feel free to raise a para on Sonee. That is enough for my satisfaction.

Sorry, but the evidence for evolution is overwhelming, creationism is a pseudo-science of no real merit, and this should be quite clear in the article.

      "First I want to point out that while it is CLAIMED in the article that Marie Antoinette was kind and noble and gracious of the peasants, NOTHING is cited to prove such. The one Antoinette quote that is offered to this end, smacks of sociopathology or her recognition that she would promote her OWN cause, by offering kindness to those who are proving themselves kind to her. There's nothing in the phrase to indicate that she was speaking of the whole of the French people, but it seems she was speaking about some particular people who had been particularly kind to her. Calculating psychopaths can be kind for this reason, so that they will enjoy camaraderie with their aids. So, this statement, that she felt she should be nice to the people who were being nice to her, certainly does NOT certify Marie Antoinette as kind hearted or noble. I suspect, that much as the phrase is thrown around today, it was probably thrown around by the clique of it's originator. They probably had a real laugh, suggesting things the peasants could eat, when they ran out of bread as happened under the leadership of every dictatorial monarchy. Here's how I imagine the phrase came to be said by Marie Antoinette is she heard her royal family, her mom and dad and step parents, maybe her grandparents, talking about what had been said in an age past, when the peasants ran out of food and started eying the national leadership as cause. Then, when she found herself in the situation, she used what was in her circle a cliche, that was widely unknown to the rest of the world. She probably didn't think much of saying it, she probably thought it would be received by her audience as cute and figured it would never get around, never become more widely known that she said it AND probably she hadn't really considered how callous it is when people are starving, to make light of it. So, my guess, is that, EXACTLY as the phrase is thrown around today for it being so pithy and the situation so often endured, peasants starving, Marie-Thérèse originated it, the phrase circulated amongst Royalty for 100 years, probably spoken of at dinner parties how pithy was Marie-Thérèse, how callous and witty and devilishly fun (from the sadistic royal perspective). So Marie-Thérèse originates it, Marie Antoinette's family speaks of it, tells the story. Marie Antoinette happens upon the same situation, bread shortage, she rehashes the phrase originated by Marie-Thérèse. Rouseau writing of it, attributing it to a Princess who he had not heard first hand say it, proves that the phrase was circulating in royal and educated circles. He says some earlier royal said it, presumably she said it to other royals and presumably Rouseau similarly heard it spoken by royals. So, obviously, if Marie-Thérèse said it, 100 years before Rouseau wrote it, obviously the phrase was conveyed by some royal story teller, who probably blathered on and on about all the corruption and hi-jinks those callous witty royals do, for love of reliving the old times and as \"\"lessons\"\" to the young royals on how to live. Marie Antoinette saying it, in royal company, would be like her saying, I'm on your side royal friends. It's basically a slightly witty way for Marie Antoinette to say she doesn't care how the peasants get through their hard times, how the royals deal with the peasants through those hard times, callous, is her intent and plan. It was a way of declaring her loyalty and making light of the situation. Many here have claimed that because Rouseau wrote it before Antoinette could possibly have said it, means that Antoinette never said it. That's OBVIOUSLY nonsense. She OBVIOUSLY didn't originate the phrase, credit Marie-Thérèse, but that wouldn't prevent her from spouting cliche as so many nim wits make habit.\"\n",

Including 'self-aggrandizing' doesn't at all suggest that that's their primary motive.  As well, there could be notable trolls or notable trolling groups who don't self-aggrandize, and certainly not to the extent and in the joie de vire manner the GNAA does.

I have already stood behind my allegation above, and I continue to do so now.

This is the fundamental thing that makes statistics worthwhile: if you have a lot of observations then the average of the sample is close to the average of the population. This is why you can , eg, do clinical trials in only a few thousand people and extrapolate to approving drugs for a population of hundreds of millions.   I agree that the article could use revision in the introduction.  I don't really like the proof, either. Only a very small number of people will understand it, and for them there is a simpler, shorter proof under similar assumptions: by algebra the variance of a sum is proportional to the number of summands, and so the variance of an average decreases as the number of summands increases.

I have nothing personal against Davey (despite what he claims), I am certainly not trying to make him afraid or upset or otherwise miserable. If he tries to claim I am, I will vigorously defend myself against such lies. If anyone has been treated unfairly, it has been me by him - he reported me for being a VANDAL for crying out loud! I assume you know exactly how wrong that was (I sadly only properly realised that after the event). AGF says \"\"If criticism is needed, discuss editors' actions, but avoid accusing others of harmful motives without clear evidence.\"\" Well, I have quite a lot of clear evidence now that Davey's lack of care in the subject area of buses/bus transport can only really be explained by him having a motive that is harmful to Wikipedia (to degrade the overall quantity and quality of its content on the subject). How else can you explain the phenomena of someone who claims to be a bus enthusiast and know a lot about buses, not having any clue how or why a list of trolleybus routes would be encyclopedic? Entire books have been written on just that subject! This is just one example. I have many more. If he had never claimed to know a lot about this subject, then yes, I could have assumed that this was just a case of amateurish but entirely innocent intent. But not any more. He clearly has a very specific idea about what Wikipedia should and should not contain on this subject, and it is quite clearly not explicitly supported by any of the rules. So, he is pushing the envelope far beyond the limits, and in some cases there's only one word to describe the things he says - pure lies. I'm sorry he's upset by the fact that I have the subject knowledge to be able to spot when he's not being truthful about certain things he says on this subject, and I'm sorry that he's upset that when he says something here breaks some rule or other, I actually take the time to check if that's true or not. But do not for a second confuse that with someone who is genuinely upset by someone stalking them or questioning their motives for no good reason. I could even go so far to say these might even be crocodile tears, since he doesn't appear to have been this sensitive over other issues where people are disagreeing with him - indeed he seems quite capable of telling people in no uncertain terms what he thinks of them.

      "Parkwells, yes, I went to the source you referred/linked to regarding other visitors to Monticello and they had this to say: These family members are not mentioned in Thomas Jefferson’s Farm Book(7) as being visitors to Monticello (The Farm Book does not appear to be a log of visitors, but lists an accounting of his plantations, e.g. livestock, land, crops, costs, and slaves.) 'Not a logbook of visitors.' Hardly compelling.Schulz, your notion that Hyland's book has 'been ignored by scholars' simply because it is not mentioned at the cite you linked to is ridiculous, esp since it has indeed been endorsed by many scholars, including former members of the TJF. Hyland is Adjunct Professor at Stetson University, College of Law, at Tampa Bay, Florida. If you think that Hyland is dead, why don't you send him an email / WHYLAND@travelers.com and see how he feels about that. You have the wrong Hyland. Hyland's book came out in 2009, the Hyland you're referring to died in 2008. Please do you homework. And if you are ready to dismiss a source because of two spelling errors it is clear that your mind is quite closed and simply can't come to terms with the idea that there are a whole body of historians, professors, who exist outside of the box you seem to have enclosed yourself in. Even Albert Einstein was a poor speller. Btw, in the same paragraph you make issue with spelling errors you make a grammatical error, leaving a word out of your sentence: \"\"That said, Hyland's book is not (a) particularly good book\"\".

This is not a predicted team roster, it is verifiable and very likely to be accurate since the chance of Team Sky confirming they have signed a contract with a rider for 2010 and then that not happening must be very slim.   \n",

      "It is verifiable that these men have signed to ride for that team next year, that is in the preceding paragraph and I would not challenge the appropriateness of stating that.  A 2010 roster (not a word that should be used on an article about a UK subject, but that is a different matter) is not something that exists in 2009, and even as a speculative list, it is so incomplete as to be meaningless; it also does not use the cycling squad template which is standard for team articles, but these are not the point.  Returning to the Crystal balling issue, you say yourself that the chance of them not riding is very slim: you thus acknowledge that this is a possibility, and therefore their inclusion in the squad is not a definite fact.  Let's hope it doesn't happen, but Sky might go bust, or any one of the signed riders might have a career ending injury, before 1 January, in which case 2010 will arrive, they will not be part of the team, and the encyclopaedia will be guilty of having recorded an error.  Facts, not expectation.    \n",

      "I will happily accept that the signing of a contract to ride for the team in 2010 doesn't mean that any of these will actually ride for the team in 2010 and that the team might not even exist. However, all these riders have been signed up to ride for the team in 2010, that makes them part of the squad for 2010. We're not simply expecting them to be, they are confirmed to be. Surely though, we would be speculating if we were to disregard that and suggest it might not happen. I think you are misinterpreting WP:CRYSTAL. I'd suggest that it makes it clear that it is perfectly acceptable to include details of future events providing the information is verifiable, as is the case here. If it turns out that any or all of these riders don't ride for Team Sky in 2010 then the Wikipedia article won't have been \"\"guilty of having recorded an error\"\" because it was an entirely accurate description of the situation at this time based upon the information available.   \n",

      "I'm not saying that it won't happen, nor that it is not very likely, but that it is expectation, not fact.  You speak of verifiability, but life teaches us that the future is not verifiable.  If they were to die before the end of this year, they will not be in the 2010 team: the future is not confirmed.

You seem to want to defend the article from speculation but in doing so, seem to be introducing your own speculation that the team might not exist or the riders might change. The names that are being announced are for the 2010 squad, so it seems perfectly appropriate to describe the list as such. We can, and should, only base the article on what can be verified at the current time, and that is that the riders named are part of the team for 2010. The information we have at the current time says these individuals are confirmed to ride for the team in 2010 and our article is, and should, only ever be based upon information available at the time.

      "There is a difference between Pink Floyd the band (which this page is about) and Pink Floyd the corporation. As Far as Pink Floyd the band is concerned, Roger Waters has not been a member since 1985. A member of a band is someone who plays in the band. Further, Roger Waters has no rights to any of the new music/albums that have come out since he left. i.e. Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Division Bell. Once again showing that he is no longer a member. Finally, Pink Floyd does not need permission from Roger Waters to release albums such as Pulse. He does get paid royalties, but that is it. Further, I fail to see how you could list \"\"The estate of Richard Wright\"\" as a member of a band. Does the estate play the piano? No. It receives royalties for sure, but that doesn't make it a band member, it makes it a corporate member. I agree with Radiopathy that they should all be listed under former members. This is inline with the template on Wikipedia for musical artists. I would challenge anyone to find a Wikipedia page on a band that lists members who are no longer active as \"\"members\"\" and not \"\"former members\"\". I would also challenge you to find a band (other than the beatles, which I agree I don't like that format) that is inactive that doesn't list it's members as \"\"former members\"\". Perhaps a good comparison would be the band Genesis. On their page only Phil Collins, Tony Banks, and and Mike Rutherford are listed, even though Peter Gabriel still own rights to aspects of the band like Roger Waters does to Pink Floyd. Also, INXS does not list Michael Hutchence as a member. Why? Because he's deceased, as it clearly states on the page. I'm sure his estate receives royalty payments. I would argue that the problem we are having is that some folks are simply unwilling to acknowledge the fact that Pink Floyd exists without Roger Waters, but I could be wrong. What's frustrating is to see that this article, which was once a featured article, deviates from the norm in more than one respect in regards to this section. 1 - it lists current members of a band that is inactive (I'd be willing to have that discussion), and 2 - even if we determine that the band is active, it lists a member who is no longer playing witht the band, and a member who is deceased. Proper form would dictate that neither of these persons should be listed.  \"\n",

      " the time the message was transmitted\n",
      " satellite position at time of message transmission\n",
      "The receiver uses the messages it receives to determine the transit time of each message and computes the distance to each satellite using the speed of light.  Each of these distances and satellites' locations define a sphere.  The receiver is on the surface of each of these spheres when the distances and the satellites' locations are correct. These distances and satellites' locations are used to compute the location of the receiver using the navigation equations. This location is then displayed, perhaps with a moving map display or latitude and longitude; elevation or altitude information may be included. Many GPS units show derived information such as direction and speed, calculated from position changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In typical GPS operation, four or more satellites must be visible to obtain an accurate result.  Four sphere surfaces typically do not intersect.  Because of this, it can be said with confidence that when the navigation equations are solved to find an intersection, this solution gives the position of the receiver along with the difference between the time kept by the receiver's on-board clock and the true time-of-day, thereby eliminating the need for a very large, expensive, and power hungry clock.  The very accurately computed time is used only for display or not at all in many GPS applications, which use only the location. A number of applications for GPS do make use of this cheap and highly accurate timing.  These include time transfer, traffic signal timing, and synchronization of cell phone base stations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although four satellites are required for normal operation, fewer apply in special cases. If one variable is already known, a receiver can determine its position using only three satellites. For example, a ship or aircraft may have known elevation. Some GPS receivers may use additional clues or assumptions such as reusing the last known altitude, dead reckoning, inertial navigation, or including information from the vehicle computer, to give a (possibly degraded) position when fewer than four satellites are visible.

      "\"The person who said that it was hit by a missile was the brother of someone on the airplane. Clearly he is going to be emotional and not a worthwhile source. The fact of the matter is that the first patrol to come across the wreckage was asked to investigate because the Joint Defense Operations Center on base detected the sound of the plane crashing into the ground. Bear in mind that the sound detector is used to listen for mortars and would hear a \"\"missile\"\" hitting the aircraft. Also, the reason the JDOC sent the first patrol to investigate was because the cameras that observe around the base were obstructed by the fog. This was the thickest fog I have ever seen. My section was the second section to be called up to respond to the crash. The first section to go out picked up the two barely surviving individuals and my section picked up the bodies with the pararescuemen. I was driving and I could barely see 75m ahead of my truck. There is absolutely no way that the enemy could spot the plane in the fog and shoot it down. Shooting down an aircraft is not an easy task for insurgents in the first place, shooting down a plane in that thick of fog, with a \"\"missile?\"\" (insurgents don't have missiles), and having a \"\"missile\"\" that doesn't make a sound is not possible and should not be given any credence. Also, the plane did not crash \"\"1.5 miles\"\" from the base. The hull of the plane and all the wreckage was about 200m from the fence, consistent with an attempted landing. You seem pretty smug and sure of yourself but the fact of the matter is that all you did was read reports from unreliable Russian websites and fancy yourself with conspiracy theories.

Yes, it has anteriority as compared to Rajput -> Rom theory, but is certainly no mainstream. It was based simply on the assumption of a name similarity and a supposed similar low status. The fact is that these two assumptions were mostly based on the anti-Romani stereotypes and prejudices. There are plenty of possibilities of making connections between the word Rom and words from the Subcontinent  and also the peculiarities of the Romanipen do not suggest at all a low caste origin. Plus, the name Domba itself in the Subcontinent do not designate a specific ethnic group, it is just an exonyom given by the hight caste to some unrelated groups that have their own ethnic names. On these grounds this theory is dismissed as unscientific. And if it finds supporters mostly among non-Roma, as fitting their ideas about Roma, this does not mean it is mainstream. The other theory is obviously well represented worldwide.\n",

The problem is that Wikipedia is increasingly used for reference by people who are not translators. They should be aware that in \"\"real life\"\" the use of \"\"voivodeship\"\" results in confusion, as foreigners usually have no idea what this word means. Some Polish people may not care about it because Polish is a reader-responsible language, so Polish authors do not need to write understandably because readers are responsible for understanding. By contrast, English is a writer-responsible language, i.e. writers in English are responsible for making their texts understandable. (I wrote about the classification and some other problems related to translation in my article, pages 101-104). Importantly, this is reflected in the Wikipedia Manual of Style, as one of the five general principles of Wikipedia is Clarity: Writing should be clear and concise.

      "  Central figures behind FishBase are Daniel Pauly and the fish biologists around him at the UBC Fisheries Centre. FishBase itself is supervised by an international consortium which fields many of the world's most prominent fish scientists. The consortium includes the FAO itself, so in that sense it would be true to say that FishBase and the FAO are entangled. The central fisheries scientist at the FAO for many years was John Caddy. Daniel Pauly and John Caddy have, over the years had conflicts which could be regarded as representative of conflicts between FishBase and the FAO. Two high profile examples that spring to mind were a disagreement in 1999 over fishing down the food web, and a conflict in 2001 over FAO fishery returns. I have never seen FishBase and the FAO disagree on the common names of fish. That issue would arises only in relation to commercially significant fishes, since the FAO does not concern itself with fish that are not commercially significant. Presumably many wide ranging accommodations and rationalisations have been made within the FishBase consortium, and suppose this would be an example of one of them. We cannot know for sure, since the consortium doesn't seem to make its deliberations public. But the attempts some editors are making on this page to discredit FishBase are, well just plain ridiculous.   23:33\n",

      "\n",
      "Candid Camera had its roots in Six Photographers, a groundbreaking exhibition held in Sydney in May 1955, which concentrated on what was still a relatively new development in Australian photography and featured the work of Max Dupain, David Potts, Axel Poignant, Gordon Andrews, Kerry Dundas and Hal Missingham.Robinson, Julie \"\"Candid Camera: Australian Photography 1950s–1970s\"\" Art Gallery of South Australia exhibition catalogMcDonald, Patrick \"\"The Way We Were\"\" The Advertiser, 20 May 2010 AdelaideNow websiteNewton, Gael \"\"Shades Of Light: Photography And Australia 1839-1988\"\" Collins Australia, 1988 (ISBN 0732224055) The work of the first three of these artists is also represented in Candid Camera. Six Photographers, an artist-initiated show that featured 200 images at a time when exhibitions of personal photographic work were rare, was regarded as sufficiently influential for the Art Gallery of New South Wales to commemorate it with a show of the same name featuring the same six photographers, more than 50 years after it had first been presented.Newton, Gael \"\"Shades Of Light: Photography And Australia 1839-1988\"\" Collins Australia, 1988 (ISBN 0732224055)Newton, Gael \"\"Silver And Grey: Fifty Years Of Australian Photography 1900-1950\"\" Angus & Robertson, 1980 (ISBN 0207141096)Art Gallery of New South Wales Exhibitions Archive AGNSW websiteAllen, Christopher \"\"Decisive Moments\"\", The Australian, 27 February 2010 The Australian website This second version of Six Photographers featured 29 images, many of them shown in 1955, and concentrated on works from the same period (the late forties through to the mid-fifties).\n",
      "\n",
      "Candid Camera, while about half the size of the 1955 Sydney exhibition, covered a significantly wider range of artists and looks not just at the foundations of Australian social documentary photography but at the era that curator Julie Robinson clearly regards as its golden age – the fifties, sixties and seventies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In line with the statements issued by the six photographers group, Candid Camera featured “images which appear unposed, spontaneous, or with their subjects captured unaware”. Though the majority of the photos in the exhibition (more than 80 in total) were taken in Australia, images by Australian photographers working overseas were also included.Allen, Christopher \"\"Unguarded Moments\"\", The Australian, 17 July 2010 The Australian websiteEmmett, Patrick \"\"Candid Camera\"\" ABC Television interview, originally broadcast on Stateline, 28 May 2010 ABC website Subjects included youth subcultures, newly arrived migrants, nuns, a number of prime ministers (though not all were in office at the time of the photo), musicians such as Bon Scott of AC/DC, and ordinary people in everyday settings: at work, at the beach and at bus stops.\n",
      "\n",
      "Photographers represented in Candid Camera included Max Dupain, David Moore, Jeff Carter, Max Pam, Robert McFarlane, Mervyn Bishop, Rennie Ellis, Carol Jerrems and Roger Scott and a number of others. Of those named, all have work held in the permanent collection of National Gallery Of Australia. Mervyn Bishop is the only Aboriginal Australian to have been included, and though his work has primarily been in New South Wales, Robert McFarlane was the only photographer to be born in South Australia. In this last regard, Candid Camera was very different to Century In Focus, an earlier large-scale photographic survey curated by Robinson, which dealt only with images taken in South Australia.Robinson,\n",

When I looked into it, I found that the subject of this article, John Brackenridge, seems to also lay claim to this title. Both were Presbyterian ministers, and both were alive and conceivably old enough to be chaplain during the period in question, but documented differences in their lives make it impossible that they are the same person. Brackenridge lived from 1772 to 1844, while Breckinridge lived from 1797 to 1841. Brackenridge was born in Pennsylvania, while Breckinridge was born at \"\"Cabell's Dale\"\", his father's plantation in Kentucky. Brackenridge married Eleanor White, while Breckinridge was twice married, first to a Miller, then to a Babcock. Further, reliable sources have Brackenridge as chaplain of the House and Senate at different periods in time, while Breckinridge is only mentioned as chaplain in the House. Does anyone know how to sort this out? I was thinking of creating an article on John Breckinridge (the younger), which presently doesn't exist, but it would be nice to hammer this out first.

It may be better for all if you turn your efforts to more fruitful and productive entries, instead of continually trying to add \"\"con\"\" to this \"\"pro\"\" entry. It was recently pointed out to me that some of my editions to the big bang entry were inappropriate, because an entry for a subject is the place to support the subject, not to tear it down. The suggestion was made to me that I move my proposed editions to where they would be appropriate, in \"\"non-standard cosmology\"\" entries. I now make this suggestion to you. If you seek to criticize iridology, you should not do it in the entry meant to explain and support iridology. Perhaps you can make an entry titled \"\"non-standard iridology\"\" or maybe even \"\"fringe theories about iridology\"\" if you want to challenge the mainstream iridologists.

Then you go on calling me a \"\"propagandist\"\"? Well give me one scientific report that says humans are anatomically optimized to eat raw meat or at least a source that says humans are anatomically optimized to process cooked meat without aggravating any serious health-issues (see this)? And exactly what scientific data did Mills provide that is scientifically erroneous? Like what is the acidity of human-stomach when food is inside stomach? and then you tout \"\"veganskeptic.blogspot\"\" as a reliable source for high-level scientific knowledge? Isn't it a tad silly to compare a Nutritionist who has been backed by the claims of other MDs and has a doctoral degree, to a random blogger? Where is the scientific journal that says humans are not herbivores? But when it comes to question your meat-eating ways, you cling to a random person as opposed to a slew of MDs who are cogently saying that the practice of eating meat is \"\"unhealthy\"\", \"\"unneeded\"\" and \"\"unethical\"\" (or something of that sort). Meat-eating is at best utterly redundant.

      "It says in the article that half-saiyan's bodies are weaker than full saiyans, but as far as I can tell this is purely speculation. The fact that, during the final battle with Cell, Gohan was stronger than his father at a far younger age, shows that it's simply not true. Goten and Trunks were also both halfbreeds and, since they both acheived super saiyan at a young age, were both stronger then their fathers at the same age. Half-saiyans not being able to acheive Super Saiyan 3 is also pure speculation - since Goten, Gohan and Trunks all stopped training hard at the end of DBZ, logically they wouldn't have gotten there. In any case, Goku was the only case of SSJ3 to ever occur, so it's very fuzzy in the area. The real proof that it's wrong, however, is that Gotenks could go SSJ3. Though you could argue that the two 'saiyan halves' double over, making him pure saiyan, this wouldn't make sense from a genetic point of view. In other words, Gotenks was a half-saiyan and he went SSJ3, so there is no proof to say an unfused halfbreed couldn't achieve it if they became powerful enough.

      "Hi.  Do you have a source for your addition to the Georgian language page where you said that ფ is pronounced as /f/ when it corresponds to an /f/ sound in loan words from Greek and other languages?  It was (and is) my understanding that when foreign words containing /f/ are incorporated into Georgian, the sound is spelled as ფ, and the ფ is pronounced normally (as /pʰ/).  For example, პროფესია (profession, occupation) is pronounced /p'rɔpʰɛsia/ (not /p'rɔfɛsia/).  As far as I am aware, /f/ is not a separate phoneme in Georgian; rather, it occurs only as an alternative pronunciation of ვ before unvoiced consonants.  Admittedly, I only know a very small amount of Georgian, so I am not in a position to put myself forth as any sort of authority on this.   (talk · contribs)\n",

      "Hello there, and welcome to Wikipedia. To answer your question, Wikipedia has a notability guideline, which tries to distinguish between \"\"notable\"\" content (from Wikipedia point of view, a notable topic is one that can be included as article) and \"\"non notable\"\" (content that may be in the future included, but as of now, not). According to our specific music notability guidelines, in order to justify an article, a band needs to fulfill any of these points. From what you wrote in that page, none of those points were fulfilled. If the band passes any of those points, you can include an article in Wikipedia. However, note that you will have to give references for such achievement, otherwise it will be speedy deleted (deleted within minutes of creation because of lack of notability). Even if it fulfills a point, note that Wikipedians can send the article to deletion (either because the notability reference is found to be fake or disputed, unverifiable or otherwise non notable), where wikipedians will discuss if the article is indeed notable by our guidelines, and decide whether it is deleted or not. I hope this answers your question.   \"\n",

There are referees, statisticians, an official rulebook, and permenant teams.  It is not just a hobby that was created without any sort of solid foundation.  It's website is growing rapidly, with nearly 6000 hits since the beginning of October.  Merely because it is local and young, does not mean that it doesn't hold a solid enough position in the world to have a Wikipedia page.  Your response to the Perl citation was a weak showing of how the UFL did not deserve a page.  Perhaps there are people who are very interested in football.

What you suggest, some form of moral policing I suppose, is utterly wrong. Who would determine what reliable sources are reporting in a way seemingly transphobic?

Stopping at 15 miles you don't even make it into Missouri, you barely make it across the Johnson County border with Wyandotte County. I'd be ok with a 15-20 mile statement, but my hang-up is you are still in Kansas Dorothy. Kansas City's Downtown is not 5 miles wide, so a more accurate range is needed. Maybe try 18-21 miles, cuz at 18 you've at least crossed the border. Yes, you can be in Kansas City at 15 miles, but you are not downtown, in fact MNU is only about 8 miles from the south part of Kansas City (take 135st/HWY150), but that is not downtown (and even further from the Kansas City International Airport). And I'm confused to why we will use the image from the institutional website claiming to the be most reliable, but yet third party site milage site is more reliable than the institutional website milage? Would not the institutional website be reliable for both? As far as 19 and 20 go... 19 is an exact measurement, and the word about was to suppose to give some leeway, as to make it an approximate of 20 (a nice even number) miles. But again, look at the maps, 15 miles gets you to about the KU Med Center, 20 miles and you are right at an exit to Union Station or Bartle Hall.

My feeling is there is no reason to go overboard questioning the basis of these claims, since it is simply possible to write the entry making clear that they are claims. It is not the place of this talk page to conduct some kind of forensic investigation into the validity or otherwise of Mr Langan's IQ (I'm not saying that is what you are doing, just making a point). I agree with you that at this high end of the scale the measurement of IQ probably becomes quite inexact, but after all that is not Mr Langan's fault. I note also that not only is there no evidence Mr Novelly is lying, neither is there any evidence that Mr Langan has lied. That doesn't make his claims true, but the claims themselves are plausible as claims, and as claims they are reported in legitimate secondary sources. I think it is clear that Mr Langan is, as you put it succinctly, frickin' smart. That is the real point of the IQ claims, and it is the basis of the interest in Mr Langan, since people are interested in the limits of how frickin' smart people can be. I note for the record that this obviously does not mean Mr Langan's CTMU theory is correct, but neither does questioning Mr Langan's IQ undermine his CTMU.\n",

Instead you write \"\"I think the misunderstanding is that PBS assumes that the word patriot has only positive connotations.\"\" Whether at the time people use the term patriot to mean a supported of the Good Old Cause or something else, its usage today implies someone who supports their nation, and if it is to be used before the UDI, then what does it mean as (the nation did not exist)?\n",
      "@ your argument \"\"The British colonists had made North America their country\"\" is I think flawed unless you think that Virginians somehow changed from being patriots to rebels between the 1770s and the 1860s. Surly in both cases they were either rebels or patriots, unless one is using the terms inconsistently. If they were rebels in the 1860 then why not use the term for the 1770s as well? Luckily one can usually substitute the word \"\"Confederate\"\" for \"\"rebel\"\" so this is not usually a POV issue for civil war articles (but using the word patriot in an article has POV connotations). For example in the main body of the text the first use of the term Patriot is in the sentence \"\"The landing of this tea was resisted in all the colonies and, when the royal governor of Massachusetts refused to send back the tea ships in Boston, Patriot mobs destroyed the tea chests\"\". In what way were the mobs patriotic? Even the phrase \"\"rebellious mobs\"\" would not be accurate. \"\"anti-tax mobs\"\" would be more accurate, but it is probably better just to drop the adjective completely from in front of mobs.    \n",

And independent evidence from growing Antarctic ice, that this year global sea ice is back to normal and even Greenland surface ice is growing strongly suggests that there is no current warming and that the surface data is corrupted either by these warming adjustments or by urban heating. Moreover the satellites are far more global than the surface data - and the increasing ice shows the areas they miss at the poles are not melting.\n",

Reverting to the biased content on women's role in soccer (Football (soccer) culture article) as \"\"soccer mom or fan\"\" is a violation of NPOV.  And removing the Norwegian Premier League for women link from the Women's football around the world article is counter-productive, in the most generous interpretation.  Perhaps it was not your intention to do anything POV.  I would appreciate if you'd collaborate.  Would you consider helping by finding a group of editors interested in improving the representation of women in football articles?  Thanks.  Deebki \"\n",

If you take away all rules and judging, then anyone can claim the record. Aaron's home run record does not include the home runs he hit in the negro leagues. Josh Gibson is not the HR record holder. You can't just go out to your local gym, alert the media and complete the lift. It has to be judged by an existing set of regulations. What is a lift? Is there a pause on the chest? Can the athlete use legs to push? Can they be on drugs? Who tests? How often? Who weighs the official plates that were used? Does it have to be a standard bench? Are you allowed to put bungee cords under your lifting shirt? When is the lift complete? Lucky for us there is already an organization, recognized by the world, that takes care of all there rules and regulations. The argument is simple. If you want to be considered the greatest quarterback of all time, you compete in the NFL, the highest governing body of that sport. Powerlifting and other sports like it have International Federations and that fact should be recognized here.\n",

      "UNPRODUCTIVE SUICIDE ATTEMPTS or why the word \"\"PRACTISED\"\" is not the case of Lubitz's earlier actions. Very often people who intend to commit suicide have had many interrupted attempts to do it when \"\"suicidal impulse\"\" is not strong enough to overcome \"\"natural fear\"\" and \"\"resistance of rational thought\"\". For example, people trying to commit suicide with a gun often put the weapon to their head and then they interrupt this action moments before they pull the trigger. Viewed from the side, those unsuccessful suicide attempts are like theatrical act but this is just an illusion because every such attempt has the potential to end tragically. In the case of Lubitz - in the situation in which he intended to carry out his suicide there are several circumstances that limit his freedom of choice to interrupt the suicidal attempt - such as \"\"returning of the Captain\"\" or \"\"what you are doing in the cabin?!\"\". These circumstances can force his unproductive suicide attempts to became productive one in any moment and he knows that after them he will have no choice to turn back. For this reason it is \"\"normal\"\" he to do first timid attempts - which were unsuccessful in the first flight \"\"Duesseldorf to Barcelona\"\" because time is not limited. On his return back \"\"Barcelona to Duesseldorf\"\" the end destination is forcing him. As I said he has not \"\"PRACTISED\"\" but was \"\"TRYING\"\" to commit suicide or in other words - he had unproductive suicide attempt.  \"\n",

Second, even if there was a way to keep Glc inside the cell, say through active transport, Glc poses a danger to the cell integrity as Glc is a highly osmotically active compound.

I've tried my absolute best to approach everything I do on Wikipedia with the most professional attitude I can. I feel under assault from Kelly, and at this point do not know how to resolve it. I could generate a very large, detailed response to Kelly's assertions regarding my conduct but at this point I despair that it would do anything but fan the flames, and honestly I don't know if I have the energy for it. With that in mind, I earlier tried to push myself above the trees and think, \"\"What do we want to come from this?\"\" and that was my motivation in my recent addition of a question to Kelly on the RfC. I well recognize that there are simply too many people on Wikipedia for everyone to like you, or you to like everyone. I even noted this to someone else recently. Unfortunately, I think I've found my first oil/water person in Kelly. I respect her work on Wikipedia, but I feel badly abused by her actions with respect to me. I asked her to bring the RfC to help bring closure to this, but now I am uncertain it will have any beneficial effect. Even if the RfC closes with a view against Kelly, it doesn't resolve the dispute. Kelly will still view me as a \"\"problem admin\"\", and will continue to consider me such with her \"\"trusted peers\"\" as she put it. So, whether this RfC concludes in my favor or not, I still lose. I fear the only possible conclusion to this that might at least stop the debate is an oath by both of us not to comment on the actions of the other. But, that doesn't stop her from casting about her belief that I am a problem admin. Sigh. At this point, I'm at a loss on how to proceed in a way beneficial to all parties including Wikipedia.

That's exactly when you guys (i.e. ADMINS) you should have a careful look: I'm not the problem, at most I am a symptom of it, because I was trying to be part of the solution by pointing out the aforementioned issues. The quality fluctations of that particular article have been severe, it seems that there's a huge mess of people editing without any relevant background knowledge whatsoever. This has nothing to do with elitism: wikipedia (or any encyclopedia) cannot just thrive through people without any domain expertise. And other users have been highlighting these issues, too - but were ignored because their criticism also affected wp admins. Really, you cannot expect high quality articles if the people \"\"writing\"\" it are merely acting like robots adding refs to articles that they don't understand, let alone briefings that they never watched in the first place. Regarding the term jackass, just look at the Jackass article, it describes fairly well what's going on there, just because there's huge public interest in the event, which attracts countless people who don't even bother getting informed in the first place, and rather prefer edit warring instead. BTW: I am not trying to talk common-sense to you, like I said: I don't care about this account and/or IP being blocked or not - not even if it should not be temporary. The real issue here is lack of quality, and lack of wp admins enforcing rules to ensure a higher degree of quality. And this problem will persist regardless of this particular account/IP/person being blocked, inactive or deleted. This seems to be a severe case of Dunning-Kruger's.

Because there are quite a few examples of more than one village in Palestine of the same name, we usually identify which district of Palestine it was in (sometimes even in the article name). The unwritten convention among the editors who work on the village articles is to use the 1945-8 districts since that is what most modern sources use.  See Districts of the British Mandate of Palestine, last section, where you will notice that we should be calling them \"\"sub-districts\"\" rather than \"\"districts\"\".  Also, writing that a village was in Mandatory Palestine won't do, since that entity only lasted about 25 years but most of the villages were there for centuries.  Saying that they were in Palestine would be more accurate.  It can be confusing, but I think \"\"Palestine\"\" along with the past tense is about the best short solution.

      "I do not know either John254 or Kristin Erikson and recently stumbled across this. But, I have to say this looks like a witch hunt with evidence that wouldn't even hold up as circumstantial. They can't prove they're not socks, so they must be. And any evidence to the contrary is more proof because it must have been deliberately planted. If we ban then and they drown, then they must have been innocent after all. Personally, I've been editing Wikipedia since the beginning (late 2001), both as an IP user and with an account that I have abandoned, so I fully understand KE appearing on Wikipedia knowing more than you think a new user \"\"\"\"should\"\". I would bet that the vast majority (like 99%) of users spend some time editing as an IP user before they create an account  the only question is how long they spend that way. It looks like KE didn't bother creating an account until she found a need to do so. That not only is not wrong, it should be encouraged.\n",
      "Like KE, I have also edited extensively as an IP. For the most part, I found no reason to create an account, but I created a new account recently with my real name and, of course, my new account appeared to be an expert about Wikipedia immediately. Like KE, I also dive deeply into things. Were you to accuse me of being John254's sock puppet, I would do the same that she did  dig into his edit history and compare it to mine to look for evidence to prove my innocence. Most of the contributors here have dug into KE's edit history and now may well know more about it than she does  are you therefore sock puppets too?\n",
      "Suggesting that defending herself with evidence, against people who are accusing her with flimsy evidence, is ridiculous. And, to argue that she would have deliberately created arguments with herself and other contrary evidence, over a long period of time, just in case anybody ever complained is hard to believe.\n",
      "At best, the evidence here looks like collusion, not sock puppetry, and I don't even see that. But, even so, there is no rule against collusion on Wikipedia. And we see it all the time, with people cooperating on edits. I personally have emailed people I know to suggest that they edit pages in which I had an interest. Doing so does not make them my sock puppet or vice versa, whether they agree with me or disagree with me. \n",
      "To me, this flimsy house of cards rush to judgment and assumption of guilt represents the very worst of Wikipedia, and I think that even if it turns out that they are witches (uh, sock puppets). And I, personally, do not believe it to be true after reading this and the information on KE's page.\n",

And ultimately, civilizations, like religions, are self-defined.\n",

They are not 'Sugababes singles' for various reasons, which I can explain to you if you still do not understand. I prefer your version of the albums' section and you're introduction is much more explanatary, which I think is very useful. So I'm not critical of the whole article, just the singles section.

The Valley Press covers the fast growing Antelope Valley - especially the Palmdale/Lancaster Urbanized Area (a US Census Bureau defined term) and adjacent areas of north Los Angeles and southeastern Kern counties, including the upscale Los Angeles urban escapes of Acton and Agua Dulce.

      "The Valley Press was founded by A.J. Hicks on Saturday, April 3, 1915 as the Palmdale Post. At the time, the Valley was home to about 3,500 people. Over the decades of the 20th century, the newspaper changed hands, and there were a few name changes as well. On May 4, 1950, the paper became known as the South Antelope Valley Press.\n",
      "\n",
      "On July 1, 1958, four men initiated a partnership between the Markham and Odett families. Arthur F. Folz was president of the board of directors in 1958, with Ralph and his brother Maurice W. Markham as vice presidents and Lamont Odett Sr. as secretary-treasurer. Ralph H. Markham bought out Maurice W. Markham, and Lamont Odett Sr. bought out Arthur F. Folz on April 1, 1961, to create the partnership of Ralph H. Markham and Lamont Odett Sr. In October 1975, Lamont Odett Sr. died and sons Bill and Monty Odett Jr. became co-publishers. On March 1, 1981, William C. Markham joined the Odetts in daily management of the paper and was elected corporate vice president and advertising director. William C. Markham became president of the board of directors after Ralph H. Markham's death in November 1985.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Markham family became sole owners of the Antelope Valley Press in January 1994. William C. Markham is president and publisher. The William Odett family had father William and his son Lamont (\"\"Monty\"\") Odett Sr. running the day to day operations of The Yuma Morning Sun (Now The Yuma Sun) with William's new wife Miriam as part of the team in the circa 1925 to 1935 period in Yuma, Arizona. When the Morning Sun changed ownership in 1935, the Odetts moved to the San Fernando Valley and later to Palmdale.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper later dropped the \"\"South\"\" from its nameplate, and became simply the Antelope Valley Press by the early 1960s. It was a Thursday afternoon weekly until 1959 when a Sunday edition debuted. The Tuesday edition was added in 1969, followed by Friday (1982) and Wednesday (1988), Saturday (1992) and finally the Monday edition in 1998, making the Antelope Valley Press a full-fledged daily newspaper - perhaps the first Mojave Desert California based newspaper to commence daily publishing with morning delivery. The paper remains in family hands, and has never been corporately owned or had nonlocal ownership.\n",
      "Technology and editorial outlook\n",
      "\n",
      "The Valley Press was famed locally from the late 1950s for its peach-colored newsprint while under the Odett/Markham family ownership. The paper stopped using peach newsprint in 1975 due to expense and the increased use of color.\n",
      "\n",
      "The newspaper moved into the digital age beginning in 1986 when City Editor Bill MacKenzie was given the assignment to find a publishing system. The result of that search was the installation of a Morris Publishing System network of personal computers for both classified and editorial requirements. That classified system was replaced in 1999 with Digital Technology Internal equipment. Editorial followed in 2002 to make the paper completely paginated in one system. The classified system was upgraded in early 2005 and the editorial system will be upgraded by year's end.\n",

      "One Direction (commonly abbreviated as 1D) are an English-Irish pop boy band based in London, comprising Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson. Zayn Malik was formerly a member leaving the band on March 25th 2015. They signed with Simon Cowell's record label Syco Records after forming and finishing third in the seventh series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor in 2010. Propelled to international success by social media, One Direction's four albums, Up All Night (2011), Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013) and Four (2014) broke records, topped charts in most major markets, and generated hit singles including \"\"What Makes You Beautiful\"\", \"\"Live While We're Young\"\", \"\"Story of My Life\"\" and \"\"Steal My Girl\"\".\n",

      "Their achievements include five Brit Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, eleven MTV Europe Music Awards, and nineteen Teen Choice Awards out of nineteen nominations, among many others. According to Nick Gatfield, the chairman and chief executive of Sony Music Entertainment UK, One Direction represented a $50 million business empire by June 2012. They were proclaimed 2012's \"\"Top New Artist\"\" by Billboard. According to the Sunday Times Rich List, by April 2013, they had an estimated personal combined wealth of £25 million ($41.2m) making them the second-wealthiest musicians in the UK under 30 years of age. In 2014, Forbes listed them the second-highest earning celebrities under 30, with the group earning an estimated $75 million from June 2013 to June 2014.\"\"Justin Bieber is Forbes' highest-earning celebrity under 30 pocketing $80m this year... which should just about cover his costly legal woes\"\".

      "You can thank me later for it but I'll tell you Parseval's identity. It's more conceptual to think of L^2 the space of measurable square-integrable functions on [-pi,pi] as a complex inner product space (Hilbert space). The idea is that the space has an orthonormal basis (general orthornormal basis can be found by wavelets) such as {e^{-in}} for n an integer. And if f is a function in L^2 you can take its inner product against each of these functions and get \"\"components\"\" of f. The point is, as you'd expect in any Hilbert space, the components are the only relevant data when it comes to taking inner products. So you can find the inner product (an integral) of two functions just by knowing their Fourier coefficients. Pretty cool math dude? So basically I advise you to find the Fourier coefficients of the function \"\"x\"\" on [-pi,pi] and take the inner product of this function with itself and apply Parseval. The PROOF of Parseval is probably well beyond the scope of your education; you'll see it when you get to university. It involves proving the completeness of the trigonometric system (in the L^2 case) which can be done nicely with convolution but I'll save the details to your lecturers at first year undergrad. uni. \n",

This Committee will advise the Government in the matter.\"\" This answer was given on 6.3.2006. Subsequently, to me also, the Minister of Culture has replied saying that it has been referred. Now, the question before the House is as to how long it will go on like this. There is a limit to the patience of the people also. They are losing their patience. You may not believe, but they are condemning and criticising the Parliamentarians and saying that Karnataka M.P.'s are dormant; they are inactive.\n",

As a matter of fact, it is only the Ministry of Culture which is in a position to take a decision with respect to this, and I would like to say that the language should unit; language should not divide. Many languages in our country are rich languages and they should be a source of our unity rather than division. So, it would be necessary for all of us to tell our brothers and sisters in the States that on the basis of language, division should not be created. Because the languages are rich; because the languages are ancient; because...(Interruptions).\n",

      "\"\"On DeVirga's map, the northwestern continent is called \"\"Norveca.\"\"  This title, appearing under the symbol of a crown, identifies the huge land as a province under the sovereignty of Norway.  Other maps also show a huge land attached to northern Norway.  On the 14th-century Andreas Walsperger map, the region is called \"\"Regnii Norwegie\"\" (the realm of Norway); maps by Sebastian Munster (1532) and Joachim Von Watt (1534) call the region \"\"Septentrio;\"\" a circular map by Battista Agnese 1543 shows \"\"Terra Nova\"\" extending from Norway to the North Pole.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Maps that portray a huge northern territory reflect the 1261 proclamation of King Haakon IV extending Norse sovereignty over all the lands from Norway to the North Pole.  The \"\"North Pole\"\" he had in mind was the magneticnot the geographic pole.  A 14th-century writer, Philippe de Mezieres, reported that Norway's overseas realm was so extensive that it took three years for the king's tax collectors to complete their rounds and return to Bergen.  \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the territories that Haakon annexed in a 1262 treaty along with Greenland and Iceland was an otherwise obscure place called landanu or \"\"New Land.\"\"  The Kongfriget Norges historie (1778) identified an Icelander named Rolf as the discoverer of this New Landalso known as Nyalandin 1258.  It was also identified as part of the North American mainland.  Bishop Gissur Einarsson noted that the direction of sailing to Nyaland from Iceland was southwest.  In that direction lies Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The region had many names that changed over the years as successive waves of Europeans landed on its shores.  As late as 1347, Icelanders referred to Newfoundland as \"\"Markland\"\"which was an ongoing source of lumber.  Sailors from Bristol called the coastal isles \"\"the Icelands.\"\"  Circa 1350, a Spanish Franciscan reported an isle called \"\"Ibernia\"\" in the northwest Atlantic that was under Norse sovereignty.  After that date, Bubonic Plague swept through European cities devastating maritime centers.  Norway was particularly hard hitforcing the abandonment of overseas colonies.  English, Portuguese, French, German, and Danish merchants fought over the western isles.  After 1380, Denmark took control of Greenland, Iceland, and mainland in eastern Canada.  The \"\"new\"\" Danish mainland appears on the Claudius Clavus map of 1424 as \"\"Gronlandia Provincia.\"\"  Thus, the name \"\"Norveca\"\" was already archaic by the early 15th century when it found its way onto DeVirga's map.  Portuguese maps of the early 16th century feature the names of Joao Fernandes (The Labrador) and the Corte-Real family along the East Coast of North America...\"\"  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 212.113.163.75   \n",

A registrar confirms that applicants grades are in order, and officially informs them that they have been admitted.  AZ ran houses where he formed an assessment as to whether applicants were good candidates for training.

      ". . . I turned to the statutes and reliefs. These would show me how the sitters impressed the artists of those days, and the work of an artist's chisel or brush is at least as good evidence as the sworn word of a witness in a court of law, at any rate when the artist is as literal-minded as were the Egyptians. Do we not know the honest mistakes a man in the witness-box can make? And shall we not concede the difference between a trained and an untrained observer?The ancient artist was a trained observer; I would examine his trained evidence on what he saw, and compare it with what I could see today of the Pharaohs. This done, discrepancies appeared which could not be disregarded. And besides, the various artists who portrayed a Pharaoh did not all agree in detail among themselves. This added to the difficulty! It was evident that some detailed and perhaps laborious comparing would have to be done. I had recourse again to the mummy, and took the face carefully back through the process of mummification.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certain confirmations appeared of the artists' evidence; these I accepted and retained, especially as they seemed to me to agree with the king's known character. Discrepancies on the other hand could be partly accounted for by the changes in the subject between youth and old age, and partly by the deference due to kings. Finally I did construct a firm scaffolding on which to build my portrait, and so the picture of Sety I was begun.The costume was a simpler problem. One had only to consult the monuments and the jewel-room of the Museum, and to be careful to avoid howlers such as a dinner party parure with a field-service helmet, and so on. Ramses II was next attempted, and I was greatly cheered by the recognition of my resuscitated kings by several eminent archaeologists. Not all the Egyptologists who recognised my portraits realised the method in my madness, the slow sifting of evidence and the laborious brick-making. To many they seemed flights of a fancy only slightly, if at all, controlled by research.\n",
      "\n",
      "''But one of the most famous of them all, namely Professor Breasted, gave me enormous encouragement. Whatever was to be thought of these particular portraits, he admitted that this was a line of research not hitherto tried, but perfectly legitimate and which might conceivably yield valuable results. His kind words so stimulated me that I made similar attempts with other defunct royalties, and gradually completed the series of kings and queens which appear in these pages.\n",

(If so, I'd like to know how you've managed to deduce this.) Do you mean that such paradoxes may in fact exist, but that the resolutions are necessarily scientific as opposed to interpretative? (If so, I'd again like to know your reasoning.)

      "Before we open any envelopes, it doesn't seem unreasonable to assume that if the envelopes are said contain A and 2A (without distinguishing which envelope contains which amount), then all values of A are equally likely − because we have no better information. However, it does not then follow from this assumption that, given A is found in the first envelope, the other envelope is equally likely to contain (1/2)A or 2A for every conceivable value of A (which is something we have implied in the subsequent calculation of expected value). \n",
      "\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "\n",
      "Because, for any specific amount of money from which to fill the envelopes, given we have found A in the first envelope, for all values of A we can always find (1/2)A in the second envelope, whereas it is only possible to find 2A in the second envelope half the time.\n",

      "See it like this: If the specific amount of money is M say, then we can find A to have any value up to (2/3)M, but the second envelope can only contain 2A for values of A up to (1/3)M ie. half as often.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, given A was found in the first envelope, the chance of finding (1/2)A in the second envelope is 2/3, and the chance of having 2A in the second envelope is 1/3 − not equal as we had assumed, even though all values of A are still being assumed to be equally likely.\n",

Wikipedia doesn't allow personal opinions in the bodies of articles, and has numerous safeguards in place to prevent it, but having your personal opinion about the nature of an article in the format of a tag, and that opinion will be allowed to disfigure the article practically forever.Were I of a mind to fight against an article I disagree with, politically or philosophically, I wouldn't try to change the text or duke it out on the talk page, I'd stick a \"\"neutrality disputed\"\" tag on it and walk away.  The tag would sit there on the top of the page, big as life, scaring people away from the article, even though I provided no evidence to back it up, and did not have to go through any process before I posted it.  In fact, by simply starting an argument on the talk page, I can provide the backing someone disputing the tag might need  and I get the argument out there without it having to prevail  simply the existence of the argument justifies the tag.I'm not at all saying that's what's going on here  as I said I'm not concerned with this specificity of this tag  but it's another example of why tags are dangerous and should not be accorded the kind of carte blanche they curently receive.  If the references and citations in this article are wanting, the place to let people know that is down by the references and citations, not at the top of the article, not as long as tags can be placed without going through a process of justification beforehand.
