I believe that her supporters were not offended by such a description; they were working people who felt abused by the economic system, and they relished such a claim. This is not to say that your edit was improper; i'd have to read the book to know more. But if your edit resulted from use of this phrase, and for no other reason, then it was (in my view) mistaken about the general perception of that description.

I'm trying to understand but all I can make of this is a statement of personal taste, and I'm not convinced. Can we try to compare arguments? To me there are two disadvantages to the old format: 1. it contains duplicate information (the \"\"To\"\" column, saying when someone lost the status of oldest person, is always — necessarily so — equal to the person's day of death); 2. it actually is less appealing to me because the information fills more space and there are many line breaks. It looks more tidy in my version. I'm therefore rather surprised at your change. Thanks for a reply. –  \n",

However, during the year two articles (Park Grill and Grant Park Music Festival) were added to the topic and the requirement was increased to 1/2 of the articles needing to be featured.

Thus, I helped raise McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink (March 23), Harris Theater (Chicago) (June 12), Millennium Park (August 31) and Exelon Pavilions (September 25) to featured.

Sadly, blocking this user Hydao (who always fought against vandalism and addition of nonsense things) will not solve the problem. Sooner, the user GVnayR will start adding completely stupid and nonsense things on Wikipedia, which is unacceptable. I will continue fighting against vandalism and nonsense stuff (added by losers/nolifers like GVnayR), with or without \"\"Hydao\"\". Now you are thinking: \"\"Hydao, you are insulting a user by calling \"\"loser and no-lifer\"\", but that's not an insult, it's just the reality. A high-functioning autistic who doesn't work, doesn't have a job, doesn't have friends, use the government pension to buy PlayStation games and pay the Internet bill, someone who spend his days/months/years doing NOTHING useful (except making frequently STUPID edits on Wikipedia and wasting other ppl PRECIOUS time...) is a big loser who needs a LIFE LESSON. I don't mind if this \"\"Hydao\"\" is blocked, the only thing I know is that GVnayR needs an \"\"ULTIMATE LESSON\"\".

But more to the point, i realised that my ability to edit the talk page was barred. After taking a look at previous edits, i realised i was being a bit of a tube. You were right to take that ability away. So just a heads up that i can only edit on anon as this account is obviously still suspended. In terms of getting unblocked, i haven't made a single edit to Wikipedia in almost 3 years, and during this time i have matured enough to the point that i look back at what i was getting up to and think 'Oh god! Who was i even trying to impress?!' In terms of where i aim to get involved in on the website, I still hold a strong interest in football (soccer) related articles, along with hip-hop and old school rock related articles- hence my music taste. As it has been so long since I bothered to use the editing facility, I'll need re-shown how to work various parts of the site or whatever it's called. I only remembered how to request unblock by clicking on the 'edit' tab and noticing one of my old templates! Furthermore, I don't intend to be an overly active user on the site, as I begin my university course in September much of my time will be dedicated towards my studies, and so I intend to see Wikipedia as a hobby to input my thoughts and research every now and then. Finally, thank you very much for reading my request - I appreciate the time taken to do so and I apologise for my past behaviour. I was just a stupid kid (it lasted from age 12-15 if I recall!) and I hope to hear from you as soon as possible. If you're wondering how I came across you, you were involved in my ban years ago.89.241.208.230\n",

Furthermore if the likes of Beinart and Kaufman are quoted, this does not make them verifiable, your best sources are not neutral and objectively acceptable, they are agenda-based commentators on the late Senator's alleged and I emphasise alleged (since it is most certainly not verified) neo-conservatist legacy. Your tedious counter-argument to this normally goes \"\"Refer me to verifiable sources to the contrary\"\". This is not good enough.

It would seem the hundreds of articles concerning The Beatles group, the Beatles members, albums, and compositions, use the syntax I just used.  [User:GabeMC] wants to  start changing all ocurrences to \"\"the Beatles\"\" mid sentence with his Straw Poll. When editors disagree he gets nasty with ridicule, argumentative and posts snipes on user talk pages. His argument is that each article can ignore WP:MOSTM on it's own consensus and only war in two or three articles, so far, on this issue. Trouble is there is no consistency in trademark usage, old documents, WP:MOS vs. WP:MOSTM, English grammar, or editor ideas that prevails with capitals or not. My concept appears to prevail in a few dozen articlesI have read. The issue has never been resolved due to behavioural issues induced into every discussion and a lack of Arbitated Policy continues the randon edits. Even it my mentioned method succeeds think of the rogue editor seeing this, \"\"When all the Beatles played together The Beatles made good music.\"\" I am only concerned with the unaddressed behaviour of this and a few other editors in these discussions. Nobody seems to want to take them on. Some agreed that a \"\"shot across the bow\"\" may be in order. Funny thing; all of the editors agree an arbitrated decision is needed but won't muzzle themselves long enough to draw serious attention. The mud slinging is unbeliveable and admins have told them to \"\"grow the fuck up\"\" and other less rude demands.

For example, current economic theory, the Efficient Market Hypothesis holds that there are no such things as trends in stock markets - the 'trends' you see are just the result of humans trying to see patterns in events that are essentially random.  A lot of that theory involves careful definition of randomness, and types of randomness.  I don't see an equivalent section in this article. \n",

      "BTW, /where/ a particular critic is published or quoted is 'technically' only relevant (for verifiability) as far as the 'reputation' of the publication. Time and Womens Wear Daily are equally 'reputable sources', in the very sense I mean, as in that if either one publishes an interview with a major personality you can be pretty damn sure the person actually said the quotes. Writing \"\"Bob said 'I love it!'\"\" is a 'statement of a fact directly known to the author'. The interviewer saw and heard the interviewee say it, unless they are lying, the publisher let them get away with it, and the interviewee didn't scream bloody murder. Doubtful for either of those magazines.\n",
      "The same critic's interview published on the fansite 'www.ilovebooks.com' fails that test (His published quotes are 'notable', but not 'verifiable'). In the little known 'Collection of My Interviews of Book Critics', written by 'Joe English Professor, Ph.D.' and published by Oxford University Press it definitely passes due to scholarly review.\n",
      "OTOH, the interview quotes of an 'unnamed Palestinean' as part of an article in Time about the West Bank pass the verifiability test, though 'notability' of the quotes would depend on context. The same article in Womens Wear Daily does not, as they are much less likely to have fact checked it as thoroughly, which is needed for something such as that. It's much more plausible that the WWD author spent his entire 'in country' time sitting in the hotel bar writing a fake article and got away with it. Get it?\n",

Also, a formal 'review' by him would have said the same thing....just in better language.\n",
      "As far as a book review by a professional, which is a 'direct statement of opinion by an expert', where the critic is published is a function of his 'reputation', not vice versa. Peeps write reviews for Time instead of The Podunk Daily because of their reputation, and the fact they are published in Time is just an indication of that.\n",
      "Say that famous reviewer retires, and only writes occasional reviews for his hometown paper, The Podunk Daily, to 'keep his hand in'.

First of all, I am not arguing over the number of each ethnic group but instead you are. I never changed the numbers, rather I changed and replaced the old 1980, hard to read and understand map of yours. My map, the one above, explains little more about each Ethnic group, while yours does not. Demographics of Afghanistan should not just be the numbers of each group but also include a brief explanation about who or what these people are and or where they originate from. By watching your actions and you keep insisting that your map remains in Afghanistan's article, there must be something you are up to. Also something I noticed, you keep talking about the numbers of Pashtuns should be lower, which indicates that you wish to see them die or something. I will slowly look around for an administrator to help with removing and deleting your silly outdated man soon. I wish not to bother talking or discussing anything with you as I find that you are not a nice person to talk or socialize with. You keep reminding that Pashtuns killed this Pashtuns killed that, why don't you discuss about Pashtuns always being killed by invaders. They have the right to rule their country and they have the right to kill anyone they find as a traitor to their country. This law is practiced in all the countries of the world. By now I've already realized that you are not just a traitor to Afghanistan but also a true enemy of Pashtuns. I have Allah (Almighty God) on my side and that's why I always win.\n",

Just paste “Premier's Climate Change Council’ into the search box on the home page.  Secondly, with respect to the “Membership” section, content explaining from what sectors of the community the members are sourced from should be added.  Also, the “dot point” lists should be converted into a paragraph of names in alphabetical order with the words “(chair)” after the person who currently has this responsibility.

      "Yogesh, maybe I did not express myself clearly enough. I was trying to say is that the atmosphere around India related articles does not look right to me. There seems to be an atmosphere of fear around these articles. I have looked into other parts of WP. This atmosphere is not there. This atmosphere seems to have developed in recent years only. Some of you seem to think that it is a WP wide phenomenon. I don’t think so. I think the atmosphere around here is bad because of just 3 or 4 bad apples. The rest of the biggies look fine to me. I do not object to anyone editing an article just because of the eds background. But presently, an entire topic of articles is being owned by a gang of 3 bullies, which consists of one catalyst and two sidekicks. They are just random googlers who do not have any familiarity with the subject. Nobody else is being allowed to edit those articles. The articles are stinking. This is not OK. I am nod saying that your above comment, or your on the kurmi talk page (which was addressed to me) are “damp”. I am nod saying that you refrain from making such comments. I am saying that if you do not think of this bad atmosphere as an issue, you need not do anything. Please do not take my comment otherwise. I appreciate your efforts. You may think about some situations as “volatile”, but I don’t. Only that damp comments can hinder the effort to free this area of the fearful atmosphere. You need not do anything. There are just 3 or 4 bad apples. After that is dealt with, you will find an entirely new atmosphere conducive to collegial editing and encyclopedia building. Please try to keep in mind and remember what I said even if some situation looks “volatile” to you. I can do it on my own.-\n",

      "The article states that \"\"The text of Genesis relates that God created everything in six days and rested on the seventh.\"\"  And I agree if you do a casual reading of English translations.  However, some commentaters, notably E. W. Bullinger, argue that the six days describes the creation of the new world after the \"\"world that was\"\".  I have researched and understand Bullinger's argument.  I will present it here.\n",

The Strongs Concordance lists one of the meanins of toho as \"\"to lie waste\"\" or simply \"\"waste.\"\"  \n",

      "Likewise, the english word \"\"empty\"\" in the NIV and the english word \"\"void\"\" in the KJV is translated from the Hewbrew bohu, G/K Number H983 and Strong's Number H922.  Strong's Concordance provides one of the definitions of bohu as ruin.\n",

      "Consequently, it is argued that the verses could be considered something like ~ \"\"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2  Now the earth was waste and ruin, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.\"\"\n",

I have tried doing EBSCO host searches and have looked for titles in my university library (the largest library in my state, mind you), and I have been unable to find a single title that is exclusively about Hillsdale College.  I suspect the reason is that, while it was once a radical college, it has become more conservative as the world has changed.  It was expected to become more radical, in the way that Antioch College did; but it didn't.

I've added two reference to the article with links to their pages on Google books (most of which are visible, at least in the UK). The print copies may also be in the Longy library:\n",

Liner Notes: Joaquín Turina (1882–1949): Piano Music, Vol. 1—is also very useful, especially for discussing his musical style and works chronology. I suggest you use these as your sources for further expansion with the biography on joaquinturina.com] as a back-up only.\n",
      " \n",
      "One thing you could do is separate out the last paragraph (beginning with \"\"His works include...\"\") with its own heading Music and expand the commentary there. For example, he was a very noted composer of art song, which is given short shrift in the article. Much has been written about his approach to incorporating Spanish musical idiom in his work and on his style in general, including its strengths and weaknesses. This is also lacking in the article.\n",

      "Another possibility, is to separate out a section at the beginning of biography to Early years where you discuss his family background and his musical education prior to Paris. The material between that section and Music could be entitled Paris and Madrid and can always be expanded in the future.\n",
      " \n",
      "A third possibility is to expand and rationalize the list of works in the article. The current one has three major problems. First, it excludes many of his important works because it relies solely on those scores available at IMSLP. Secondly, it gives no indication of each work's type. Thirdly, it gives no indication of the date of their composition. Listing them alphabetically, is not a good way to go. If you do decide to concentrate on improving the works list, I suggest using List of compositions by Claude Debussy by genre as a model, although in this case, the list would not be a separate article, but rather continue to appear in the Selected works section of Joaquín Turina.\n",

      "I see this as an important issue that requires extreme caution. [I’m speaking generally as I haven’t had the time to try to analyze Yoyohooyo’s  specific assertions.] Of course the Massei report is biased. It’s trying to justify the court’s (prosecution) point of view. Whether or not it is deliberately MIS-leading is something we cannot prove or disprove. But by definition, it IS “leading”, i.e. it leads the reader to follow the judge’s reasoning. If the judge’s reasoning is incorrect (deliberately or not) or based on false assumptions, then the report is misleading. That would seem to be the reason for the policy on primary sources and in this case we have to follow not only the general guidance on primary sources, but the stricter rule: WP:BLP/Misuse of primary sources: Do not use trial transcripts and other court records, or other public documents, to support assertions about a living person. That seems pretty cut-and-dried. Maybe the report can be used to confirm what the court concluded, but anything more than that (including details that the court believes to be \"\"facts\"\" in reaching its conclusion) would seem to be prohibited as they are \"\"assertions about a living person\"\".  Demanding other RS’s, which may not exist, as an alternative to the Massei report is not a valid argument for using a prohibited source. At the risk of climbing on a soapbox, I will add that’s the problem with this article. We want to provide accurate, reliably-sourced facts; but too few facts are indisputably known and I fear that many of the sources we might like to rely on have been less careful in their scrutiny of officially-provided \"\"facts\"\" (what the prosecution and court have allowed to be released) than we are trying to be here. If we remove all contentious material, the article would be shorter and contain few details. And maybe that would be a good thing.   \"\n",

      "Yep, that all makes perfect sense, and the move is uncontroversial with me and the page's creator, with whom I discussed this a bit on the Talk page when I made my initial, ill-fated moves.  Just to clarify what I was after with singular v. plural (so as not to appear a plodding dolt), I meant that if we were to push an article toward being about a genre in which works can be referred to in the singular or plural, the singular seems to be the preferred usage in discussing genre.  A point of general interest: the other, singular pinakes listed in the Suda entry aren't considered parts of the work known as the Pinakes, that being Πίνακες τῶν ἐν πάσῃ παιδείᾳ διαλαμψάντων, καὶ ὧν συνέγραψαν.  I don't know that I believe that interpretation of the testimonia and fragments, but who am I?  Going this route, I'd actually be alright with no mention of the/any Pinakes appearing on the Pinax page: this uncited bit about a map picture is a bit too creative for my taste, considering the other basic meaning and the existence of the πίναξ ἐκκλησιαστικός at Athens.

In fact, it got a lot of ink in Greil Marcus' Invisible Republic/Old, Weird America and I can't remember off the top of my head if Clinton Heylin talks about it a lot, but I always thought it was quite famous in its own right as one of the \"\"great, unreleased\"\" Basement tracks.

      "Answer: You use the date July 20 of 1599 AD as Thot 1 and retreat one date back every 4 years, or 30 days back in 120 years. Example, 240 years is 60 days back to May 21 of 1839 AD, or Apr 21 of 1959 AD, then add 13 days in our 1900 or 2000 century to have Gregorian May 4 in 1959 AD. Another 44 years to 2003 AD and 11 leap days takes all the dates back to April 23. Then 2004-2007 is April 22. In reply to the post below which says the Coptic calendar is not Egyptian, the answer is our September 11 as Thot 1 is Julian August 29. Though the Coptic calendar (Egyptian with leap days) was accepted in 284 AD (which Era of Diocletion is the Era of Christian Martyrs so coincidentally the year 6000 of Adam in the Jewish book of Josephus published in Rome), this calendar leap day was created in 27 BC by Augustus Octavius Caesar who inaugurated it in 25 BC when Thoht 1 becomes August 29. Therefore, the Coptic calendar is Julian (not Gregorian). Events against America have been on Egyptian dates. The August 2 invasion of Kuwait is Julian July 20 and the invasion takes place at 30 degrees where the rise of Sothis occurs on that date only at that latitude; this implying Saddam chose the rise to invade. However, they felt world trade controlling oil was USA blame. Another date is Thoth 1 was Feb 26 in 747 BC. In 1993 the world trade was bombed on Gregorian Feb 26 not taking into account that Julian Feb 26 is March 11 (March 10 in leap year). The Coptic calendar honors this date as the half year placing Pamenot 1 on March 10 and the internet terrorists attempt to destroy world trade by constantly revising the March 10 virus.\n",

There are some elements of tribal society developing (Arbcom and administrators fill a role 'tribal elders' in loose tribal aggregates, policy and guidelines take on an almost mystical/devotional role in some discussions), but on individual pages it still largely devolves to conflicts between small ideologically insular groups fighting for control of a resource.

These features are noticeably absent from many of the more contentious discussions on project.  If we are not willing to take the steps to achieve a properly functioning consensus system, then we would really do better to try for another less-open approach, because dysfunctional consensus systems are ugly, ugly, ugly beasts.

      "Wikipedia is not a dictionary but an encyclopedia, therefore, the content and title name of an article there, necessarily needs to be encyclopedic, not as in the case of dictionaries. The naming of the sweet cannot straightforwardly choose as Rasgulla. However, the naming in Wikipedia appears to be followed only the Oxford dictionaries, as an anglicize name loaned from a foreign country. But the name obviously misspelled there, as the dictionary mentions rasgullā originates in Hindi – so the name to be disambiguated to avoid confusion with Rosogolla for the reasons many reliable English-language sources mentions the sweet name Rosogolla, The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets describes Rosogolla is primarily associated with West Bengal, then Bengal in British India. The fact establishes the origin of the sweet is in Bengal - a part of greater India, not Hindi, in Bengal the sweet is called Rosogolla since its initial usage.  \n",

Whereas, considering the deleted article Rosogolla's naturalness, consistency, prevalence in many reliable English-language sources, as well as its usage around 250 million Bengali people in Bangladesh, West Bengal, other states in India and world over, the name Rosogolla has come into majority use. The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets highlights Rosogolla, and describes often-spelled Rasgulla, it is a very new edition published in the United Kingdom and the US. The name Rosogolla has been preferred in several publications in United Kingdom and the US. Some of these books are (1) Milk - Beyond the Dairy: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food... by Harlan Walke, Page 58. (2) Strategic Management: Formulation, Implementation and Control, by PEARCE, Page 179. (3) Food Culture in India, by Colleen Taylor Sen. There are too many reliable English sources in United Kingdom and the US those mention the sweet as Rosogolla. A confusing entry in the Oxford dictionaries cannot really overlook Rosogolla’s merit as a title name from the reliable English-language sources.\n",

I decided to do some digging and here is something i noticed about the article you pointed out and a change a made during the last peer review. /index.php?title=Phishing&diff;=15483821&oldid;=15478316.  If you look at the compared version of in the link i just provided and the link you gave, you'll see that the paragraph's match after i made a copy edit.  Not previously to that.  If the older version matched the link you provided I would have said otherwise. But after i made a few random changes from what the text originally was, the newer text matches that of what was supposedly copied, I am inclined to say that whoever created the article in the link you provided copied off of wikipedia.  I have seen this happen before with other articles.  May you look into finding a date when the article you gave was created/copyrighted, because I have a feeling that it was created after this article was written.   Talk \"\n",

It was about time they honor their due!

To reiterate my original explanatoin to James: I'm interested in this more on a meta level (how do we approach controversial subjects) than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards Moore and his film; that is, I'm trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about.  For an encyclopedia based around the concept of a Neutral Point of View, any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is, in itself, an editorial statment seems wrong; such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article.  See, for example, something like Roe v. Wade  there's no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved  there are other articles for that linked at the bottom  just state the facts about the case.  Even if you really consider Moore's movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda (and to risk the Wiki-equivalent of Godwin's Law here), note that the article on Triumph of the Will doesn't feel the need to explain all the reasons why Nazi Germany wasn't all it was cracked up to be.   Similarly, shouldn't we just describe the content of the movie (noting that it is controversial), and then if we want an article about the Bin Laden family departure or whatever we can put the facts about that subject there?   20:19, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)\n",

I think the first person who posted may have a point, however to Telaviv one, although i agree with you that nearly every 'communist' regime has become a tyranny or mobocracy, you also have to realise that nearly every communist regime has not been at all orthodox Marxist. In orthodx marxism (which I dont support) Russia in 1917 would not have been fit to enter communism because it was mainly inhabited by a majority of agriculturalists, it was backwards, and most of its populace was uneducated or illeterate. China qualified even less, as it was totally backwards, and Mao basically disregarded orthodox Marxism, not to even mention cambodia or vietnam. I dont think was perfect, and I am no communist, but I think ideas can be learnt from every notweworthy philosophy, even Marx. You also have to realise Marx's motive for supporting communism was moral/ideological, whereas perhaps with the majority of revolutionary communists the reasons were nationalistic or materialistic, and therefore more associated with the right. What I am saying is that if Marx dictated that communist states should function as they have and do today, yes maybe human rights violations would deserve a mention, but his ideology is not to blame, it is the [people who follow his ideology who often commit the crimes.86.150.147.133   User: R.G.P.A\n",

The point is that we cannot prove that the editors who used the sources showing in google books search results only saw and used the snippet view.  If we are to assume good faith here, we should believe they did actually see the full texts, cited them, and provided the links to google books as the best available online target (it's better to have a link to a snippet view rathen than to nothing at all, wouldn't you agree?).  However, this does not mean you or anyone else cannot ever question the validity of these cites—what it does mean is that to be able to question them you'll have to have something better than logically-enhanced mind wanderings (such as one above).  Which brings me back to my original recommendation—find the books, read them, and if they indeed are not acceptable as references, remove the sentences in question.  If, in turn, anyone questions the results of your analysis, well, they'll have to get their own copy of the books on their own, after which you can go through the pleasure of discussing both sides' interpretations of the sources on the article's talk page, instead of accusing the other party of what may or may not have been the case of OR/SYN/plain negligence to do a proper research...— • (yo?); 17:31, March 30, 2009 (UTC)\n",

I therefore appreciate your placing the information on the talk page, for you never know, a serious researcher rather than just a casual visitor who takes a general interest in primary legislation may derive genuine satisfaction in finding it there; the very distinction, I hope you will agree, that marks an encyclopaedia (which should be an extensive knowledge resource) apart from a penny guide-book.  A few points however:\n",
      "You have left some external links (Blair, Kelly) which had relevance to the detailed former footnote but not to the article.\n",
      "There is a balance between referencing all statements and introducing clutter.  \n",
      "The bullet-point statements are accurate (and, in point of fact can be verified easily enough by looking at the linked pages).  And as to technology, if you have a way to put a reference on a footnote using the edit pages, then you are a lot cleverer than I am.\n",
      "Your criticism is a little disparaging.  It may of course be both accurate and justified, but pejorative language such as yours is quite difficult to read with a constructive attitude.  Perhaps it needs charity?  May I suggest that for the sake of the average grump you adopt the style of academia (which I admire but am no part of), which is to achieve a result coming up with an improvement rather than a half-baked detraction?\n",

      "What is more, defense experts concede that ID is not a theory as that term is defined by the NAS and admit that ID is at best “fringe science” which has achieved no acceptance in the scientific community…ID is reliant upon forces acting outside of the natural world, forces that we cannot see, replicate, control or test, which have produced changes in this world. While we take no position on whether such forces exist, they are simply not testable by scientific means and therefore cannot qualify as part of the scientific process or as a scientific theory.\n",

      "Intelligent design (ID) is an anti-evolution belief asserting that naturalistic explanations of some biological entities are not possible and such entities can only be explained by intelligent causes.*  Advocates of ID maintain that their belief is scientific and provides empirical proof for the existence of God or superintelligent aliens. They claim that intelligent design should be taught in the science classroom as an alternative to the science of evolution. ID is essentially a hoax, however, since evolution is consistent with a belief in an intelligent designer of the universe and with an unlimited number of other metaphysical myths.\n",
      "And here is The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience:\n",
      "Essentially, most neo-creationists (among whom there is quite a bit of variation) do not believe in a young Earth, accept micro-evolution (though recently so do some classical creationists), don't believe in the literal truth of the Bible, and don't even call themselves creationists - the preferred term for their version of things is \"\"intelligent design\"\"\n",

But the section above that talks about how helpful edits do not need to be reverted. Our one goal here is to build an encyclopedia. Reverting positive contributions to the encyclopedia just because a user is banned (or for any procedural reason, for that matter) is counterintuitive. So the general rule in these situations is to use common sense. If the banned user's edit is not helpful, revert. If it's obviously helpful, don't revert (or don't think you need to). If you're not really sure whether it's helpful, you should probably err on the side of caution and revert. But at the end of the day, blindly reverting any addition made by a banned user really doesn't help anyone, and whether to revert or not is left to your own discretion. In this case, there's clearly a disagreement, so I would recommend you explain exactly why you think their edits should remain, and discuss the issue with Hobartimus.

I thought with it being in the withdrawal section people realise that it was referring to people withdrawing or withdrawn and recovering from benzos. It is not about the risks of mixing benzos and alcohol and enhanced side effects but is talking about replacing one cross tolerant drug with another cross tolerant drug, they work similarly in the brain so basically drinking alcohol is like staying on benzos and worse because alcohol is more toxic.

Slandering an academic with words such as this: 'Dadrian is only good at one thing: Propoganda and Forgeries' is worster than calling some anonymous user a liar. Also, it would be interesting that you highlight the words which you think would qualify as ban material. Also, don't worry, other than slandering academics like this, which is a clear cases of diffamation and is criminal under the laws of his state, deepblue06 isen't immune of making personal attacks like accusing me of hallucination.  But since that articles talk page is in a choas, I won't take part in scrutinizing who slandered whom most by whom and to whom.

      "Nope.  The word \"\"hippie\"\" was in use before it referred to the hippie subculture.  Read Hippie (etymology).  Unless you can find a secondary source showing that the Rolling Stones were using it to refer to the subculture, then you don't have a dispute.  We don't do original research.  The Fallon citation isn't sourced to Fallon: it's found in multiple sources that make that claim.  Take a look at the citation in the Hippie article: Perry 2005, p. 19; Sinclair, Mick. (2004) San Francisco: A Cultural and Literary History. Signal Books. p. 205. ISBN 1902669649; Singleton, Carl. Wildin, Rowena. (1999). The Sixties in America. Salem Press. p. 334. ISBN 0893569828; Stevens 1998, pp. 299-300; Tompkins 2001, vol. 7: 1960-1969.  Now, all you have to do is find one that refers to the Rolling Stones.  The addition of McCleary's \"\"numerous theories abound as to the origin of this word\"\" is a great start in the right direction.  The next step is to find sources for additional theories.

After 10 days the discussion was still very much active and no warning was given of deletion, or consideration of the fact that I requested mediation to resolve serious questions pertaining to bias and bad-faith.  Also, during deletion review I have shown that it is doubtful that the closing admin even read the AFD arguments properly and probably wasn't even aware that mediation had been requested.  This admin says there was clear consensus but the fact is that it was claerly shown during AFD that the advocates for deletion could not motivate their own statements, instead chosing to default anyway with \"\"Delete\"\" endorsements.  I am told that the onus of proof lies on me yet I have addressed every single criticism repeatedly whereas they could not and did not submit proof for their own statements.  Also there were many supporters who presented arguments for 'keep' (probably outweighing the number who wanted 'delete') but these arguments were never addressed and the guys at deletion review are telling me that these contributions have zero weight because the people who want to 'keep' are all first-time users.  Deletion review is also proving unhelpful and in my opinion also biased with nobody seriously considering the arguments that have been raised, or really prepared to read through the AFD discussion properly.  I have no idea of what to do next and in fact if anything can be done.  I am extremely disillusioned with this process as it is obvious that prejudgements and lots of Wiki-speak are employed to 'prove' unsuitability, rather than arguments being actually objectively considered.

The thing with Martha and Jonathan is that they aren't going to get any bigger. We still have season 9 ahead of his, and potentially season 10, which means potentially more appearances from these members as well as new ones. The only problem I forsee is that they have not greenlit a season 8 companion yet, because sales on season 7 weren't that great. But, as far as these specific characters go I should be just fine. I have a whole section in season 6 companion on their costumes (which I can probably scan that image and overlay it with their traditional comic book representations for a new gallery image). I also have some stuff about Alaina's costume as Black Canary. I really only need to find some reception stuff and it should be fine.   (Contact me) \"\n",

In regards to F.'s status as a reliable source however, there should be no argument about that. F. most certainly qualifies. He is one of the most high-profile scholars on the Arab-Israeli question, he has received plaudits from other greatly respected experts in the field (see Schlaim's endorsement above, or that of Raul Hilberg who supported his work and said he would be \"\"vindicated\"\" by history), and he has written best selling books on the conflict that have been  praised both inside and outside academia and translated into multiple languages. His book A Nation on Trial was named a notable book for 1998 by the New York Times. His latest book \"\"Beyond Chutzpah\"\" was published by the University of California Press after perhaps the most thorough peer review of any book on the conflict ever. These achievements demonstrate that he is unquestionably a reliable source in Wikipedia terms.\n",

F. was denied tenure only because someone didn't like his attitude. But there is nothing in Wiki policies that disqualify sources on the basis of some alleged flaws of personality.

      "Paul talks about the war because that is what the liberal media types want to talk about, but I have seen several reports that the average \"\"conservative voter\"\" is not primarily concerned with the war and wants to hear much more about real border security, stopping abortion on demand and protecting second amendment rights; in this specific order.  Many neo-cons want the war to continue and don't want to talk about it at all; I don't agree with that either, it should be fully discussed. However, Paul says that he would much rather discuss other conservative issues and that the war is only discussed because the media types bring it up. I just think that we should consider making the order that which is the priority of our primary audience for this page. If conservatives are coming to this page with particular interests and priorties, why should we let the liberally biased mainstream media dictate the order; after all they won't even print a fair and objective story on the good man or reveal details of how their secretive \"\"scientific polls\"\" are conducted or whether he was excluded altogether? Statistics don't lie, the mainstream media apparently does. Wikipedia is our chance to right this wrong and give our audience what they seek in the order that they seek it.  07:15, 12\"\n",

I don't know what your reason is for adding the range (9.43%-70% muslim), but I don't think that lack of religious data is a good enough reason to manipulate the results of a separate survey and rely on outdated, informal, far from accurate data from Ottoman times.  The results of the survey accurately portray the current religious picture of Albania.\n",

Or add a sentence about Google's cookies, and stick the CIA sentence right next to it in the Google-Watch article. By having these other articles, you can justify keeping PIR just a tiny little stub.

I then wrote a second letter to defend the university because I felt my intentions were taken advantage of. I wanted to complain not trash the university. The following summer I had some work expierence which was not too bad but I still felt a bit uncomfortable about this newspapers stand to North Cyprus higher education. I did an interview with the Rector at the time Prof. Dr. Halil Guven which was not published. The next summer I translated positive artices from the Press office at EMU for 2-3 months and again they were not published. To be honest I have not been following what they have been writing since then, but as soon as I read that this article was written at Cyprus Today I am now certain that this newspaper has a negative stand point on TRNC higher education therefore, I do not think they are a reliable source on these matters.

Moriori deleted all the links I added instead of only the one problem link (which I believe was caused by the Parliament site being in flux at that point due to Carter's resignation, as cut and paste is usually straightforward). He made no attempt to simply fix the error. He made no attempt to contact me so I could fix the error. He then implied he did NOT delete everything, when he should have at least apologized for that error. He blamed me for everything, and in an insulting, condescending, arrogant way. Finally, he selectively edited our disagreement on his Talk page to make himself appear to be in the right. As a supposedly experienced Administrator (I note he started editing in 2003), all that is very wrong. I refuse to waste my time with a project which puts destructive people in leadership positions.

When I took you to task for your poor revert, you said you thought it was vandalism and said \"\"'Endways, thank you for the massage\"\". I commented that I'd save that comment for your RfA as well as the fact you revert as vandalism an edit which isn't vandalism. There were a couple of other to and fros, including you telling me to \"\"give you a brake\"\". I was maybe a bit slow in twigging that your first language may not be english, or maybe you have health considerations interfering wtih your writing, but if either is the case, that reinforces my belief that your edits might bear random examination in the best interests of Wikipedia.

      "Atabek again when you call Kasravi a pan-Iranian nationalists and not acceptable, then I can call Tapper an anthropologist which he is.  If Kasravi is quoted by scholars such as Minorsky, Frye, Savory then his historical works are obviously acceptable.  Also note this: []  Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Sources should be appropriate to the claims made: exceptional claims require stronger sources. See Wikipedia:Verifiability#Sources..  Note that is why I quote from Savory a Safavid historian and say that he is stronger source than Tapper who is an anthropologist.  And furthermore I asked for direct proof with regards to your statement.  Actually you quote says: Esmail I proclaimed himself Shah of Azerbaijan.  Now I ask where?  And then you bring me a quote from Tapper who is an anthropologist.  Then I of course say that Savory who is a Safavid historian with much more qualifications does not claim Esmail I made such a proclamation.   It is true that he controlled Gilan also (but perhaps not all of it).. As per Iran , it is mentioned as the country of Safavids by many sources.  Including Sultan Selim I when he attacked Iran. \n",
      " تا ز استانبول لشکر سوی ایران تاختم تاج صوفی غرقه خون و ملامت ساختم.  Thus we have a direct source referring to the country of Esmail I as Iran .  And I do not need to bring direct reference like this because Safavid historians are strong enough source to quote.\n",
      " Note I repeat from the source. Although initially ruler of Azerbaijan only, by the year 916/1510 Esma@¿^l was master of the whole of Persia, having crushed the residual forces of the Aq Qoyunlu and driven the Uzbeks out of the northeastern frontier province of Khorasan..  seems correct but either way it is from strong source.  But until we have proof of proclamation from Esmail I himself  I am the Shah of Azerbaijan, then claiming Esmail I proclaimed himself shah of Azerbaijan is not valid.  He proclaimed himself Shah in Azerbaijan is different though as he was crowned in Tarbiz.  And yes he did own part of Gilan as well, and this angle can be argued from Encyclopedia Islam quote which I have brought above already.  So basically I am asking you for the Minorsky quote you mentioned but quoting from an anthropologist when it contradicts Safavid historians or when Safavid historians are stronger source in my opinion is not valid.  \n",

      "The section titled The era of the est training (1971 - 1984) says: He [Werner] started to see the world as perfect \"\"the way it is\"\" and reported an insight that his attempts to change or modify either his physical circumstances or his mental outlook had their basis in a conception of the world (that it should differ from \"\"the way it is\"\") that precluded or at least limited one's experiential and creative appreciation of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This attempts to describe a pivotal evet in Werner's life that he referrs to as a transformation. I felt that the description above fell way short of what it was that Werner has said he experienced. I'm not sure what the source of this material is. Describing an experience like this is exceedingly difficult. Seeing the world as perfect actually, I believe, was only a part of Werner's experience of transformation. Here is how Werner described it in his own words in the film Transformation: The Life and Legacy of Werner Erhard.\n",
      "\n",
      "The way est happened was very simple. I had this transformational experience. I had a transformation. Whoever I had been up until that point I no longer was. I was on my way to work and there was nothing significant about it but I was on the Golden Gate Bridge. I just happened to be there and that's when I had the realization that what my life was about was really meaningless. It was empty. And this realization that the things that I thought were so significant like looking good and winning, just the normal things that most people think are important, that they really had no importance, that it was all empty and meaningless. When I broke through the sadness, broke through the sense of despair of having wasted my life, I all of a sudden realized \"\"My God, I'm free.\"\" What's that mean to be free: free to choose, free to create a life that was worth living.\n",

It broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to 1975, and equalled their biggest margin of defeat, tied with a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920, leading it to be described as a national humiliation. The game also saw Germany score the most goals in World Cup history, their 223 overtaking Brazil's 221. Their second goal meant Germany's Miroslav Klose reached 16 World Cup goals, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. The game was subsequently referred to by the press as the Mineirazo, evoking the spirit of the Maracanazo in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay.\"\n",

They have translated the relatively synonymous terms 'Khristós' and 'Messiah' into English, giving each a distinct usage. Joseph Smith seems to have followed the same patterns in translation, because the purpose of a translation is to convey the meaning of the base language, not to be overly literal. Obviously, the word \"\"Khristós\"\" would not have been etched on the plates; the Nephites didn't speak Greek, just as they didn't speak French (see the end of the Book of Jacob). Joseph Smith chose to translate whichever word or character WAS written into the English word \"\"Christ,\"\" because that is how \"\"Christ\"\" is used in not only modern English, but in the English Bible itself. The fact remains that English Bibles use the terms \"\"Christ\"\" and \"\"Messiah\"\" in the same way that the Book of Mormon does, which the critics fail to mention (and they do not fault the Bible for doing so).\"\n",

He rewrote Wikipedia’s articles on global warming, on the greenhouse effect, on the instrumental temperature record, on the urban heat island, on climate models, on global cooling. On Feb. 14, he began to erase the Little Ice Age; on Aug.11, the Medieval Warm Period. In October, he turned his attention to the hockey stick graph. He rewrote articles on the politics of global warming and on the scientists who were skeptical of the band. Richard Lindzen and Fred Singer, two of the world’s most distinguished climate scientists, were among his early targets, followed by others that the band especially hated, such as Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, authorities on the Medieval Warm Period.\n",

      "All told, Connolley created or rewrote 5,428 unique Wikipedia articles. His control over Wikipedia was greater still, however, through the role he obtained at Wikipedia as a website administrator, which allowed him to act with virtual impunity. When Connolley didn’t like the subject of a certain article, he removed it — more than 500 articles of various descriptions disappeared at his hand. When he disapproved of the arguments that others were making, he often had them barred — over 2,000 Wikipedia contributors who ran afoul of him found themselves blocked from making further contributions… In these ways, Connolley turned Wikipedia into the missionary wing of the global warming movement.\n",

I felt I did not get ample time to discuss the article before it was taken down.  I admit I made several accounts trying to get around dcandeto.  Firstly, I created Cdub1985 a run off of the guy I wrote about, and then jazzy 006, jazzy 007, and I got my friends to try and keep it on.  Honestly, my attacks against dcandeto have been stupid and anger motivated, and attempting to delete his article was an act of frustration but I do not feel he asserted the importance of the writer he wrote about.  Honestly, what I wrote was not a vanity article, and I just thought it would be cool to have an article on wiki but the way I was so quickly attacked and had nothing explained to me was unreasonable and I retaliated.  You know I treated dcandeto bad, but I feel he should be more understanding and helpful towards newcomers instead of trying to delete work ASAP.  Thanks.\n",

The fact that, for the two years ending last Sunday, the account  was almost entirely inactive, its only contributions being changes in spelling, pruning of video-game weapon descriptions, and racial invective, makes it suspect as a part-time puppet account, or perhaps an artificially-aged shell-identity.  In the past week, it has made nearly as many edits as it had since its inception some years ago.  What's more, these have caused considerable disruption in the community.  I have seen this pattern of behaviour before in destructive users who are trying either to deflect guilt and reprisal from yourself onto other Wikipedians, or to make a name for a vandalism-only account by artlessly effecting a major change, such as an article deletion or a user block.\n",

If you look at what is supposed to be my userpage (I say supposed because I have a Blackberry which seems to share an IP with probably 28 million other people), you will see a whole catalogue of entries I am supposed to have edited in a negative fashion to the extent that I was banned from making further edits. The problem is that I only edited 2 entries - for The Russell Tribunal and Stop The War. I firmly disagree with the reasons given for reverting these 2 edits - both organisations are openly anti-Israeli (and actually quite happy to be portrayed as such). I merely pointed this out.

To many \"\"the Nazis\"\" does not mean the Germans as you suggested. Poland was not occupied by the \"\"Nazis\"\" who came from \"\"Greenland or Mars\"\" or \"\"Nazi allies\"\". Poland was occupied by the Nazi Germany or German Army (Wehrmacht) and at the beginning of the war also by the Soviet Union or Red Army. There were no other German allied troops occupying Poland unless you count Italian, Spanish and other Waffen SS troops marching to the Eastern Front. \"\"The German-led Nazi occupation\"\" you suggested is also incorrect, there was no such thing. Half of Poland was incorporated into the Third Reich with their citizens either murdered or expelled into the \"\"General Government\"\" which was created and %100 controlled by the Nazi Germany, nobody else. \n",

Every Jew hiding outside the Ghettos was immediately shot by the Germans. His rescuers and rescuers family was also killed.  I don't dare to suggest that you did not know about that.

Territorial division is a serious and often deadly issue.  Moreover, Brits tend to be more tolerant of the mixing of cultural, ethnicity, and legal issues because they live without a written constitution.  Jsa84 could learn from this attitude.  The second revealing problem with Jsa84's language is that Jsa84 underscores geographically as if this modifier is going to clarify anything. The discpline of geography is made up of several branches and, until you specify whether you mean political geography or other kinds of geography, you haven't resolved anythingyou haven't even begun.  This page is one of the more inconsisent pages available, and not just internally, but in relation to other pages that deal with consitutional and cultural issues in the United Kingdom.

He had already lived for a century or more in Wind Waker. Furthermore I think Kaiju is debatable. The term Kaiju is Japanese for \"\"strange beast\"\" and as Ganon is indeed a strange fictional beast of Japanese origins he could be classed as a Kaiju. The Kaiju category is pretty much the same as the Fictional monsters category but it can also encompass creatures in mythology as well as fiction so by those standards I think the Loch Ness Monster and the classic European Dragon could be classed as Kaiju.   \"\n",

      "Your comment- Well, quite frankly, not everyone subscribes to that notion, and it is quite wrong of you and a handful of others to push your ideology onto people who hold a different opinion on the matter. There is simply no actual person named \"\"Chelsea Manning\"\" here. What we have is a man named \"\"Bradley Manning\"\" who wants to be called by this other name (and awhile ago it was reportedly \"\"Breanna\"\") and referred to as \"\"she\"\". That is all. That is the reality that the article should reflect, the policy of WP:COMMONNAME. Bradley Manning was a solider in the United States military. Bradley Manning was caught passing classified intel to unauthorized parties, convicted, and sentenced. After that, Bradley Manning decided to be called \"\"Chelsea\"\". That is how the flow of the article should be, these are all things that a man named Bradley Manning did, you can't just flick a switch and rewrite history to say \"\"Chelsea Manning was convicted of violating the Espionage Act...\"\" and so on. That just isn't historically accurate or truthful. When and if he legally changes his name, that is when the transition process of the article should begin. That all was simply way too soon.  I want you to know that I agree with you 100%. Your comment was one of, if not the best on the talk page. I just wanted to let you know.   \n",

You wholly capitalise on your own fantasies and call anybody else's neutrality to be POV-pushing.  You do not believe in seeing that others have equality with your standing, but sure get upset when it is not percieved to have been given you by others.

In the specific case of psychology their mistakes add to the perception that this is a wishy washy discipline void of a body of knowledge and ANY facts.

He was in China (representing Peru in that Communist country) at the time of the self-coup, and he lost his seat in the chamber of deputies after that.

I spent several minutes to highlight these problems and how they can address it.

Doing this we make them a better Wikipedian.

Lists by the British Film Institute etc are different as they are made via a consensus with the worlds leading critics and industry persons and an explanation is provided as to why each film was chosen etc. What is being contested by me is just a random list that is noted by the publisher as being biased and arbitrary (which means chosen randomly with no reasoning) This is like a TV network saying the views of such and such do not reflect those of the station.

      "As documented by the former Royal Canadian Mounted Police undercover agent, Mr. Patrick Walsh, in a recently published book in Canada, \"\"The Unholy Alliance\"\", Zionists have played a major role in promoting \"\"Nazi\"\" and other allegedly anti-Jewish movement. The much publicised \"\"Nazi\"\" leader Lincoln Rockwell was a creature of the Zionist terror machine, and played a major role in persuading rich American Jews that they should contribute to the Zionists, who would protect them from threatened \"\"anti-Semitism\"\". Patrick Walsh thoroughly exposes the role of the agent provocateur. The Walsh exposures have, according to Canadian reports, thrown the Zionists and their dupes into some confusion. \n",

Zionist thuggery has been used against lawful patriotic groups right around the world. The League of Rights has constantly warned against extending encouragement to any type of violence, stressing that evil policies can be defeated through the British system of constitutional government. \n",

The use of the term Empire of the Greeks (Latin: Imperium Graecorum) to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire also implied that in the West it was no longer seen as the Roman Empire. The authority of the Byzantine Emperor as successor of Roman Emperors, was challenged by the coronation of Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III in the year 800. Needing Charlemagne's support in his struggle against his enemies in Rome, Leo used the lack of a male occupant of the throne of the Eastern Roman Empire at the time to claim that it was vacant and that he could therefore crown a new Emperor himself. Whenever the Popes or the rulers of the West made use of the name Roman  to refer to the eastern Roman Emperors, they preferred the term Imperator Romaniæ instead of Imperator Romanorum, a title that Westerners maintained applied only to Charlemagne and his successors.\"\"\n",

Moreover, a redlink is a useful navigational tool, in that it shows people where we cannot help them yet. If you don't remember 4-5 years ago, one of the biggest growth tools to encourage new editors was read links (read Wikipedia:Red link). But precisely this kind of overreach on policy, to make Wikipedia look complete and not a WP:Work in Progress prevents new people from finding ways to contribute - and discourages people from making good faith attempts at contributing. Please don't let this kind of legalism perpetuate the decline in editorship,\n",

Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others \"\"have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system\"\", Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with \"\"- For a start,\"\" Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#RFC_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!  And again I made the distinction in \"\"the clearest possible words\"\" when I proposed here, as my first(!) point in an suggested outline,  Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#Suggested_outline.2C_please_consider_and_discuss \"\"differentiate a specific numeral script (eg, Arabic Western, Arabic Eastern, Devanagari) from the numeral system (ie, Indian-Arabic, which includes many numerals scripts), the rest of the article should maintain this, it should also keep in mind what the readers may have searched for when looking up this article and cater for those needs (eg, is the reader looking up the Arabic Western numerals script or the Indian-Arabic Numeral system?)\"\", and then again zocky, who prefers my version and is against yours, made the same disctinction Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#What_this_page_is_about.
